  "fixes_applied": [
    "Implemented strict schema validation in FilterAgent",
    "Added failure modes (degraded/failed) in TTS and ScriptGen",
    "Added skip logic in AvatarAgent for missing audio",
    "Enforced stage_status tracking across all agents",
    "Verified thread safety of TTSAgentStub (COM initialization added)"
  ],
  "status": "stable",
  "conclusion": "The orchestration logic is stable. Data flows correctly from Filter to Avatar. Routing works as expected. Failure handling is robust (no crashes). Performance optimization for TTS is recommended for higher throughput."
