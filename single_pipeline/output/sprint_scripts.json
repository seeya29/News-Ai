    "script": "[Style: Professional newsroom tone, clear and concise. | Audience: general]\nHeadline: Simulating and understanding phase change | Guest video by Vilas Winstein\n\nStory: Deriving the Boltzmann formula, defining temperature, and simulating liquid/vapor.\n@SpectralCollective has the second part: https://youtu.be/yEcysu5xZH0\nYou can play with a simulation of this model here: https://vilas.us/simulations/liquidvapor/\nThese lessons are funded directly by viewers: https://3b1b.co/support\nHome page: https://www.3blue1brown.com\n\nNotes from Vilas:\n1) This open problem is to prove the ergodicity of the deterministic dynamical systems that are used to model the molecule-level physics. A good example of such a dynamical system is the box with particles evolving according to Newton's laws with elastic collisions, like in the video.\n\n2) This video assumes that all probability distributions are discrete, which is the case in the simulations. But one can also set up this formalism for systems with continuous state spaces. Again, a good example is particles in a box, which are not restricted to a lattice, which is only used for visualization purposes in this video.\n\n3) Strictly speaking, these \"derivatives\" don't make sense since in our simulations the energy can only take on a discrete set of values.

When the denoiser is called on x_{t-1} during DDPM sampling, it is expected to have a certain noise level (let's call it sigma_{t-1}). If you generate x_{t-1} from x_t without adding noise, then the noise present in x_{t-1} is always smaller than sigma_{t-1}. This causes the denoiser to remove too much noise, thus pointing towards the mean of the dataset. \n\nThe text conditioning input to stable diffusion is not the 512-dim text embedding vector, but the output of the layer before that, [with dimension 77x512](https://stackoverflow.com/a/79243065)\n\nFor the vectors at 31:40 - Some implementations use f(x, t, cat) + alpha(f(x, t, cat) - f(x, t)), and some that do f(x, t) + alpha(f(x, t, cat) - f(x, t)), where an alpha value of 1 corresponds to no guidance.
