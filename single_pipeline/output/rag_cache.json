There&#39;s also a dedicated part of the pad&#39;s design for an Apple Watch, which uses a proprietary charging standard, to power up too. Just note that you&#39;ll need a newer model of phone and the latest iOS 26 in order to take full advantage of the 25W charging capability. The wireless pad also comes with both a charging plug and a cable.

In Lego form, our little friends look…kinda strange? I&#39;m not the biggest Lego builder, but I am a rather accomplished architect in <em>Minecraft</em>, so I am well aware of the innate challenge in constructing a rounded shape from square blocks. Take Pikachu, for instance. Part of his appeal is his chubby little cheeks. There are bricks with more rounded sides in this collection that hint at his usual rotundness, but the proportions of his face just feel a little off to me. I had the same reaction to the other figures as well, although Eevee seems to have fared a little better than the others. They&#39;re all sort of cute, but not nearly so cute as they are in other formats. But like I said, Lego is not my personal block of choice, so perhaps I&#39;m in the minority here! If you love these bricky pocket monsters, then roll on over to Lego&#39;s website and snap up these kits faster than a Mewtwo.</p> \n<p>\n <core-commerce id=\"07a593e6a4ec4528b3a5be4a04e3e558\" data-type=\"product-list\" data-original-url=\"https://www.lego.com/en-us/product/pikachu-and-poke-ball-72152\"></core-commerce></p> \n<p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/legos-first-pokemon-sets-are-now-available-for-pre-order-205527102.html?src=rss",

    "title": "Dell revives its XPS laptops after a boneheaded rebranding",
    "body": "<p>Last year, <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/computing/dell-dumps-its-pc-brands-to-be-more-like-apple-194524781.html\" data-i13n=\"cpos:1;pos:1\">Dell killed off all of its PC brands</a>, including the iconic XPS lineup, and replaced them with a simplified naming scheme. It was a move meant to make it easier for people to discern between the company&#39;s many brands, but in reality, it just just made the company&#39;s lineup even more confusing. We called it an unforced error at the time, but after seeing how much Dell&#39;s PC market share fell over 2025, it&#39;s fair to say that rebranding was an absolute marketing disaster. </p><p>So, with its tail between its legs, Dell has returned to CES some welcome news for its fans: <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/computing/laptops/it-took-guts-for-dell-to-admit-its-mistake-heres-how-xps-will-make-its-big-comeback-233248173.html\" data-i13n=\"cpos:2;pos:1\">XPS lives</a>! And the company plans to double-down on the brand in ways it never did before. Today, Dell revealed the new XPS 14 and 16 notebooks, which feature a more practical design than the previous models. There&#39;s a new function row with traditional keys, instead of the odd capacitive buttons that disappeared in sunlight. And while the company is sticking with its &quot;invisible&quot; trackpad, which sits flush alongside the wrist rest, there&#39;s now a light border around the edges that lets you feel exactly where the trackpad begins and ends.</p><div><div style=\"left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;\"><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/eJXQ5B7W2sY?rel=0\" style=\"top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;\" allowfullscreen scrolling=\"no\" data-provider-name=\"youtube\"></iframe></div></div><p>So, in short, Dell seems to have solved most of our recent complaints about the XPS lineup. To signify its commitment to the brand, it&#39;s also emblazoning the XPS logo on all of these new machines, replacing the previous Dell name. That’s something I could never imagine a less humbled Dell doing. </p><p>The redesign also gave Dell room to shave off some weight and thickness from both machines. The XPS 14 weighs around three pounds now, a half-pound lighter than the previous generation, while the XPS 16 weighs 3.6 pounds, a whole pound lighter than before. The new cases make both machines look a lot more like Microsoft’s extra-subtle Surface Laptop, but that’s not necessarily a bad thing. Both systems are powered by Intel’s new Panther Lake Core Ultra Series 3 chips, and they also offer tandem OLED display options.</p><p>Dell also briefly teased the return of a new XPS 13 later this year, which is set to be the company’s thinnest and lightest notebook ever.  Dell says it’ll be cheaper than the XPS has been in the past.</p><p>The new XPS 14 and 16 will be available on January 6, starting at $2,050 and $2,200, respectively. A Dell representative tells us these aren’t entry-level configurations, instead we can expect to see cheaper prices with lower specs in February.</p><p><strong>Update 1/6/26, 12:30p: </strong>Pricing updated to reflecrt new numbers from Dell. Originally, we were told they would start at $1,650 and $1,850.</p><p><strong>Update 1/12, 3:00p: </strong>Added a mention of lower entry-level configurations coming eventually.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/computing/laptops/dell-revives-its-xps-laptops-after-a-boneheaded-rebranding-001028029.html?src=rss",

    "title": "CES 2026 proved the PC industry is hosed this year",
    "body": "<p>Dell&#39;s <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/computing/laptops/dell-revives-its-xps-laptops-after-a-boneheaded-rebranding-001028029.html\" data-i13n=\"cpos:1;pos:1\">XPS 14 currently costs over $2,000</a>. An AMD executive predicts that PC builders will likely make piecemeal upgrades this year, instead of building entirely new systems. And new AI supercomputers from NVIDIA and AMD are gobbling up the RAM market. At CES 2026, it was hard not to notice the dire year ahead for the computing industry, one that will likely lead to higher prices and more limited availability for consumer goods across the board.</p><p>Really, though, the show just confirmed what was apparent since <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/social-media/engadget-podcast-wtf-is-up-with-ram-with-will-smith-from-the-tech-pod-141442002.html\" data-i13n=\"cpos:2;pos:1\">RAM prices skyrocketed over the last few months</a>, driven by demand from AI datacenters. As Samsung&#39;s marketing leader, Wonjin Lee, <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-01-07/samsung-warns-of-price-hikes-as-rising-memory-costs-affect-all\" data-i13n=\"cpos:3;pos:1\">told Bloomberg</a> at CES: &quot;There&#39;s going to be issues around semiconductor supplies, and it&#39;s going to affect everyone. Prices are going up even as we speak.&quot;</p><p>At first, it appeared that Dell&#39;s new XPS 14 and XPS 16 were among the earliest systems hit by these demands. Last year&#39;s models started at $1,699 and $1,899, respectively, and we were initially told the new models would actually come in cheaper at $1,650 and $1,850. At the moment, the XPS 14 starts at $2,050, while the XPS 16 is $2,200. A Dell representative tells us these aren’t entry-level configurations, instead we can expect to see cheaper systems below $2,000 in February. While those prices haven’t been finalized, the reps say it should be similar to the earlier figures we were given.</p><p>It’s also worth noting that it didn&#39;t take much to configure the earlier models upwards of $2,000. It’s just unfortunate that Dell doesn’t have cheaper configurations available for the launch if its new systems, especially since they look so compelling. Meanwhile, Apple still hasn&#39;t budged its $1,599  MacBook Pro 14-inch pricing. At least Dell still comes in cheaper than the $2,499 MacBook Pro 16-inch.</p><p>On the desktop front, AMD&#39;s David McAfee, Corporate Vice President and GM of Client Channel Business, noted that the longevity of the company&#39;s AM4 and AM5 platforms might be a boon for gamers, since they can upgrade their CPUs without buying new RAM kits and motherboards. That allows for a pathway to better performance without paying out the nose for over-priced RAM.</p><p>&quot;I think that will be potentially a trend that we see in 2026 with more component upgrades, as opposed to full system swap outs and, and altogether rebuilds,&quot; he said in a group interview with Engadget and other outlets. &quot;Some of the most popular CPUs that are still running in gamers’ platforms are parts like the 2600 back to the Pinnacle Ridge days, or 3000 series... Stepping even from there into a little bit more modern 5,000 series processors in an AM4 socket and motherboard, there&#39;s a pretty big boost there.&quot;</p><p>McAfee added that around 30 to 40 percent of AMD&#39;s business still revolves around the AM4 platform, even without the specter of a wild memory market.</p><p>&quot;There&#39;s no product that has memory in it that&#39;s immune to some of these forces around DRAM pricing and, and what it&#39;s doing to the market,&quot; he said, when asked about potential GPU price increases. &quot;I think the, the truth is the volatility that we&#39;ve seen over the past two months or so has really been unprecedented.&quot; </p><p>Looking ahead, he said he expects prices to settle within the first three to six months of the year, but he didn&#39;t discuss his reasoning further. As an aside, he also noted that AMD&#39;s X3D chips, which feature 3D V-cache, actually don&#39;t see much of a hit from slower RAM. Their high amounts of onboard L2 and L3 cache make up for less ideal memory transfer speeds, McAfee said.</p><p>That McAfee commented at all about the state of RAM is noteworthy. Every PC maker I’ve asked, including Dell and Acer, refused to comment on the volatile state of the memory industry ahead of CES. Perhaps they were hoping things would calm down before they had to price their new systems. Ultimately, they’re beholden to an increasingly limited supply of RAM. </p><p>And where is all that memory going? At CES, NVIDIA announced its new <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"link\" href=\"https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/inside-the-nvidia-rubin-platform-six-new-chips-one-ai-supercomputer/#:~:text=Table_title:%20From%20NVIDIA%20Grace%20to%20Vera%E2%80%94scaling%20the,CPU:%20900GB/s%20%7C%20Vera%20CPU:%201.8TB/s%20%7C\" data-i13n=\"cpos:4;pos:1\">Vera Rubin AI supercomputer</a>, which supports up to 54TB of RAM across 36 Vera CPUs and 20.7TB of memory across 72 GPUs. AMD, as well, announced its <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.amd.com/en/blogs/2026/from-ces-2026-to-yottaflops-why-the-amd-keynote.html\" data-i13n=\"cpos:5;pos:1\">new Helios AI rack</a>, which supports up to  31TB of memory across 72 AMD Instinct MI455X GPUs. Given the endless appetite for computing to power AI model building and inferencing, there’s likely going to be a significant demand for these beastly systems.</p><p>Put simply: Our global supply of memory is being sacrificed to appease the AI industry. That’s good news for the likes of OpenAI, Microsoft and NVIDIA, but bad news for anyone who cares about PCs and the consumer products we use every day. Get ready for a year of price hikes.  </p><p><strong>Update 1/12, 3:00p: </strong>Added a mention of lower entry-level configurations coming eventually.</p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/computing/ces-2026-proved-the-pc-industry-is-hosed-this-year-174500314.html?src=rss",

For instance, you could ask Claude to organize your downloads folder, telling it to rename the files contained within to something that&#39;s easier to parse at a glance. Another example:  you could use Claude to turn screenshots of receipts and invoices into a spreadsheet for tracking expenses. Cowork can also navigate websites — provided you install <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/ai/claudes-chrome-plugin-is-now-available-to-all-paid-users-221024295.html\" data-i13n=\"slk:Claude in Chrome;cpos:3;pos:1\">Claude’s Chrome plugin</a> — and make can use Anthropic&#39;s <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"link\" href=\"https://claude.com/connectors\" data-i13n=\"cpos:4;pos:1\">Connectors framework</a> to access third-party apps like Canva. </p><div><div style=\"left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;\"><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/WBNZpAWhw5E?rel=0\" style=\"top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;\" allowfullscreen scrolling=\"no\" data-provider-name=\"youtube\"></iframe></div></div><p>&quot;Cowork is designed to make using Claude for new work as simple as possible. You don’t need to keep manually providing context or converting Claude’s outputs into the right format,&quot; the company said. &quot;Nor do you have to wait for Claude to finish before offering further ideas or feedback: you can queue up tasks and let Claude work through them in parallel.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p> If the idea of granting Claude access to your computer sounds ill-advised, Anthropic says Claude &quot;can’t read or edit anything you don’t give it explicit access to.&quot; However, the company <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"link\" href=\"https://urldefense.com/v3/__http://claude.com/resources/tutorials/claude-cowork-a-research-preview__;!!Op6eflyXZCqGR5I!H4Kg5gp_7yMadnW8YNEBXhHxFfRXLlqiUWXMTjA_hFLzMfx0bTA_OeGZT1TyI4CviOt0JcJuN-CbfRe6TM4kUQ$\" data-i13n=\"cpos:5;pos:1\">does note</a> the system can &quot;take potentially destructive actions,&quot; such as deleting a file that is important to you or misinterpreting your instructions. For that reason, Anthropic suggests it&#39;s best to give &quot;very clear&quot; guidance to Claude.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Anthropic isn’t the first to offer a computer agent. Microsoft, for example, has been pushing Copilot hard for nearly three years, despite <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/ai/it-seems-like-most-windows-users-dont-care-for-copilot-195500516.html\" data-i13n=\"cpos:6;pos:1\">seemingly limited adoption</a>. For Anthropic, the challenge will be convincing people these tools are useful where others have failed. The fact Claude Code has been universally loved by programmers may make that task easier.   </p><p>For now, Anthropic is giving users of its pricey <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/ai/anthropics-max-plan-offers-nearly-unlimited-claude-usage-for-200-per-month-170032710.html\" data-i13n=\"cpos:7;pos:1\">Claude Max</a> subscription first access to the preview. If you want to try Cowork for yourself, you&#39;ll also need a Mac with the Claude macOS app installed.

However, if you missed that offer or just want to try out Disney+ and Hulu for a brief period of time, this is a good way to do so.</p> <span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span>\n<p>\n <core-commerce id=\"b28a2c9fc4054925875eb91d0c7e1cbe\" data-type=\"product-list\" data-original-url=\"https://www.disneyplus.com/\"></core-commerce></p> \n<p>Disney+ and Hulu make one of the most balanced streaming pairs available, blending family-friendly favorites with acclaimed originals and network TV staples. Disney+ brings a vast library of animated classics, blockbuster franchises and exclusive content from Marvel, Pixar, Star Wars and National Geographic. It’s the place to stream nearly every Star Wars film and series, plus the full Marvel Cinematic Universe lineup and Disney’s most recent theatrical releases.</p> \n<p>Hulu balances things out with a more adult-oriented lineup of current TV shows, next-day network episodes and a growing roster of award-winning originals. The platform hosts series like <em>The Bear,</em> <em>The Handmaid’s Tale</em> and <em>Only Murders in the Building</em>, alongside comedies, thrillers and documentaries that regularly feature in awards conversations. It’s also the home for next-day streaming of ABC and FX shows, making it especially useful if you’ve already cut the cable cord but still want to keep up with primetime TV.</p> \n<p>The Duo Basic bundle ties these two services together under a single subscription, offering a simple way to expand your library without juggling multiple accounts. This tier includes ads on both platforms, but the trade-off is significant savings compared with paying for each service separately. For many households, that’s an acceptable compromise when it means access to such a wide range of content.</p> \n<p><em>Follow </em><a data-i13n=\"cpos:3;pos:1\" href=\"https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals\"><em>@EngadgetDeals</em></a><em> on X for the latest </em><a data-i13n=\"cpos:4;pos:1\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/deals/\"><em>tech deals</em></a><em> and </em><a data-i13n=\"cpos:5;pos:1\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/best-tech/\"><em>buying advice</em></a><em>.</em></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/the-disney-hulu-bundle-is-on-sale-for-10-for-one-month-right-now-192814784.html?src=rss",

Just use the code <strong>NEWYEAR2026</strong> at checkout to get the discount.</p> \n<p>Monarch Money makes for a capable and detailed budgeting companion. You can use the service via apps for iOS, Android, iPadOS or the web, and Monarch also offers a Chrome extension that can sync your Amazon and Target transactions and automatically categorize them. Like other budgeting apps, Monarch Money lets you connect multiple financial accounts and track your money based on where you spend it over time. Monarch offers two different approaches to tracking budgeting (flexible and category budgeting) depending on what fits your life best, and the ability to add a budget widget on your phone so you can know how you&#39;re tracking that month.</p> <span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span>\n<p>\n <core-commerce id=\"78691f6e9a994323adf7b4c97f1ff66d\" data-type=\"product-list\" data-original-url=\"https://www.monarch.com/\"></core-commerce></p> \n<p>How budgeting apps turn your raw transactions into visuals you can understand at a glance is one of the big things that differentiates one app from another, and Monarch Money offers multiple graphs and charts to look at for things like spending, investments or categories of your choice based on how you&#39;ve labelled your expenses. The app can also monitor the spending of you and your partner all in one place, to make it easier to plan together.</p> \n<p>The main drawbacks Engadget found in testing Monarch Money were the app&#39;s learning curve, and the differences in features (and bugginess) between Monarch&#39;s web and mobile versions. Still, for 50 percent off, the Monarch Money is well worth experimenting with if you&#39;re trying to save money in 2026, especially if you want to do it collaboratively with a partner.</p> \n<p><em>Follow </em><a data-i13n=\"cpos:3;pos:1\" href=\"https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals\"><em>@EngadgetDeals</em></a><em> on X for the latest </em><a data-i13n=\"cpos:4;pos:1\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/deals/\"><em>tech deals</em></a><em> and </em><a data-i13n=\"cpos:5;pos:1\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/best-tech/\"><em>buying advice</em></a><em>.</em></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/apps/monarch-money-is-offering-50-percent-off-its-budgeting-app-for-new-users-204507767.html?src=rss",

Users also get streaming access to thousands of curated titles. Think of it like Netflix for audiobooks. The catalog is limited, but it gets the job done in a pinch. Subscribers do get access to all Audible original content and they will receive discounts on purchasing audiobooks outright.</p> \n<p>In other words, it&#39;s a neat little service and well worth a buck.

    "body": "<p>Laptop power banks come in handy if you often travel or work away from your desk. These larger batteries have enough capacity to refill your computer to around 75 percent, giving you many more productive hours. Of course, they can also charge smaller devices like your phone, camera or tablet a few times over. Nearly all portable laptop chargers fall below the 100-watt-hour mark so you can bring them in your carry-on when you fly. Additional features, like built-in cables and digital displays make these battery banks easier to use, too. We tested over a dozen options and put our thoughts below, so you can find the best laptop power bank for your next trip away from an outlet.</p> \n<h2 id=\"jump-link-table-of-contents\">Table of contents</h2> \n<ul> \n <li><p><a href=\"#jump-link-best-laptop-power-banks-for-2026\">Best laptop power banks for 2026</a></p></li> \n <li><p><a href=\"#jump-link-what-to-look-for-in-a-laptop-power-bank\">What to look for in a laptop power bank</a></p></li> \n <li><p><a href=\"#jump-link-how-we-test-portable-laptop-chargers\">How we test portable laptop chargers</a></p></li> \n <li><p><a href=\"#jump-link-other-laptop-power-banks-we-tested\">Other laptop power banks we tested</a></p></li> \n <li><p><a href=\"#jump-link-laptop-power-bank-faqs\">Laptop power bank FAQs</a></p></li> \n <li><p><a href=\"#jump-link-recent-updates\">Recent updates</a></p></li> \n</ul> \n<h2 id=\"jump-link-best-laptop-power-banks-for-2026\">Best laptop power banks for 2026</h2> \n<p>\n <core-commerce id=\"bfc8c2b6f6f94db4ab62ca13b37f3c5b\" data-type=\"product-list\" data-original-url=\"https://www.amazon.com/Anker-Portable-Multi-Device-Charging-Retractable/dp/B0DCBB2YTR?th=1\"></core-commerce></p> \n<p>\n <core-commerce id=\"bff4cdee9c92428c9b0f0b2950ca3889\" data-type=\"product-list\" data-original-url=\"https://lionenergy.com/products/eclipse-mag?\"></core-commerce></p> \n<p>\n <core-commerce id=\"882261a65dd548a88f6f6dadcaacc66b\" data-type=\"product-list\" data-original-url=\"https://www.amazon.com/Anker-Portable-Charging-TSA-Approved-Included/dp/B0F66LNB8D\"></core-commerce></p> \n<p>\n <core-commerce id=\"93040e801db04ff58041327bddd17697\" data-type=\"product-list\" data-original-url=\"https://www.amazon.com/Baseus-Charging-Portable-Charger-20000mAh/dp/B0BZP6R4MH\"></core-commerce></p> \n<p>\n <core-commerce id=\"96ab6e6143bc4b8aa07058b53ca09010\" data-type=\"product-list\" data-original-url=\"https://www.amazon.com/Goal-Zero-Wireless-Portable-Generation/dp/B0BFBTR94M?th=1\"></core-commerce></p> \n<p>\n <core-commerce id=\"c89419ccd88044dc8b96d9c1d6bdbe4e\" data-type=\"product-list\" data-original-url=\"https://www.amazon.com/UGREEN-25000mAh-Portable-Charging-Compatible/dp/B0BJQ7F16T/\"></core-commerce></p> \n<h2 id=\"jump-link-what-to-look-for-in-a-laptop-power-bank\">What to look for in a laptop power bank</h2> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-flying-with-a-laptop-power-bank\"><strong>Flying with a laptop power bank</strong></h3> \n<p>Most portable batteries top out at around 27,000mAh so you can fly with them.

A similar situation happened that same year in July on a domestic <a data-i13n=\"cpos:9;pos:1\" href=\"https://www.the-independent.com/travel/delta-lithium-battery-explosion-b2785087.html\">Delta flight, </a>and again in August on a transatlantic <a data-i13n=\"cpos:10;pos:1\" href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/video-smoke-plane-cabin-midflight-portable-phone-charger-fire/\">KLM flight</a>. As a result, some airlines, including <a data-i13n=\"cpos:11;pos:1\" href=\"https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/major-airline-announces-ban-series-182956108.html\">Emirates</a>, <a data-i13n=\"cpos:12;pos:1\" href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/05/21/nx-s1-5406294/southwest-airlines-will-require-passengers-to-keep-chargers-visible-due-to-fire-risk\">Southwest</a> and others have announced further restrictions on flying with battery packs.</p> \n<p>Rules include limiting the number of allowed portable chargers and requiring flyers to keep power banks in clear view when using them to recharge a device. If the battery pack isn’t actively in use, however, most rules allow them to stay in your carry-on bag in the overhead bin. Before flying, it’s wise to check your airline’s policies.</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-capacity\"><strong>Capacity</strong></h3> \n<p>If you just need to keep a smartphone from dying before you can make it home, just about <a data-i13n=\"cpos:13;pos:1\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/computing/accessories/best-power-bank-143048526.html\">any of the best power banks will do</a>. But if you need to revive multiple devices or the substantial battery of a laptop, you’ll want something with a high milliamp-hour​​ (mAh) capacity. A power bank capable of delivering enough power to a laptop will have a capacity between 20,000 and 27,000 mAh.</p> \n<p>If you want something even bigger than a laptop power bank, and don’t need to fly with it, you’ll likely want to look into portable power stations. These can be the size of a car battery or larger and can potentially fuel an entire weekend away.</p> \n<p>Another thing to keep in mind is that the capacity listed in a power bank&#39;s specs is not what will be delivered to your devices. As I mentioned, the capacity of these banks is around 25,000mAh. Even the huge battery on a 16-inch MacBook Pro or a Dell XPS 16 has a mAh rating of around 5,000 - 6,000mAh, so you might think you’d get five full charges but in reality, you only get about a single 70-percent charge. The voltage is different (typically 3.7V for the power bank and 11.4V for a laptop) which makes the watt-hours, or the amount of energy each battery can hold, different (working out to 92Wh for the battery and 72Wh for the built-in laptop batteries). On top of that, in order to feed a charge from a power bank to a laptop, a voltage conversion takes place and that dissipates a decent amount of energy.</p> \n<p>Without turning this into a physics lesson, this all means that a power bank with a 25,000mAh (or 92Wh) capacity will typically fill a 5,000mAh (or 72Wh) laptop battery to about 75 percent. In my tests, I averaged about a 60-percent efficiency rate between a power bank’s listed capacity and the actual charge delivered.</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-ports\"><strong>Ports</strong></h3> \n<p>Every large power bank I’ve tested has at least three USB ports, with a mix of USB-C and USB-A, which should cover nearly any portable device you need to recharge — earbuds, phones, tablets, laptops, you name it. In addition to the different plug formats, some ports supply power at different wattages. For example, one built-in USB-C port might be rated for 60 watts, while the one next to it is rated for 100 watts. So if you’ve got a device that’s capable of 70W fast charging, such as the new MacBook Air, you’d want to opt for the 100W port to get the best charging speeds possible.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Note that devices with a smaller wattage draw won’t be negatively affected by connecting to ports with high ratings. For example, a Galaxy S24 Ultra, capable of 45W super fast charging, is perfectly compatible with the 100W port. A device will only draw what it can take, regardless of what a port can supply. Just remember that the port, device <em>and</em> charging cable need to be at or above the desired wattage rating to achieve maximum charging rates.</p> \n<p>Some of these larger batteries also have AC ports. It might seem like a natural fit to plug in your laptop’s power adapter for a recharge. But really, the AC port should only be for devices that can’t use USB — such as a lamp or a printer. Plugging a power adapter into the AC port only wastes energy through conversion. First, the battery converts its DC power to supply the port with AC power, then the power adapter converts that AC power back to DC so your laptop can take it in. And as you’ll remember from physics class, each time energy is converted, some is lost to heat and other dissipations. Better to cut out the middleman and just send that DC power straight from the battery to the device.</p> \n<p>Also, you can use more than one port at a time with these devices; just remember that the speed of whatever you’re charging will likely go down, and of course, the battery is going to drain proportionally to what you’re refilling.</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-wireless-charging\"><strong>Wireless charging</strong></h3> \n<p>Since I first started testing portable power banks a few years ago, wireless charging capabilities have noticeably improved. The first few I tried were painfully slow and not worth recommending. Now the wireless pads built into power banks are impressively fast — particularly, in my experience, when charging Samsung Galaxy phones (though the lack of a stabilizing magnetic connection like Apple’s MagSafe means they only work when rested flat on a pad). Most wireless charging connections can be used while other ports are also being employed, making them convenient for some mobile battlestation setups.</p> \n<p>Of course, wireless charging is always less efficient than wired, and recharging from an external battery is less efficient in general. If you want to waste as little energy as possible, you’re better off sticking to wired connections.</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-design\"><strong>Design</strong></h3> \n<p>All power banks are designed to be portable, but there’s a big difference between a pocket-friendly 5,000mAh battery and one of these laptop-compatible bruisers. Most of the latter weigh between a pound and a half to two pounds, which is a considerable addition to a backpack. Many of the options listed here have a display to tell you how much charge remains in the battery, which is helpful when you’re trying to judiciously meet out charges to your devices. If a bank has a wireless connection, the pad is usually on the flat top and any available AC connection is usually at one end. Both may require you to engage those charging methods. Don’t be like me and grumble loudly that you got a bum unit without pressing (and sometimes double pressing) all the buttons first.</p> \n<h2 id=\"jump-link-how-we-test-portable-laptop-chargers\">How we test portable laptop chargers</h2> \n<p>For the past three years, I’ve been testing and using dozens of portable batteries for our <a data-i13n=\"cpos:14;pos:1\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/best-power-bank-143048526.html\">other battery guide</a>. Some of those batteries include the higher-capacity power banks you see here. I also got a hold of a few extra banks just for this guide to make sure we covered what’s available. I went for brands I’m already familiar with, as well as battery packs from well-received manufacturers I hadn’t tried before (like UGREEN and Lion Energy). I only considered banks with at least a 20,000mAh capacity and mostly stuck with those that rated 25,000mAh and higher.</p> \n<p>Here’s everything we tested:</p> \n<ul> \n <li><p><a

\n<p>I tested each power bank with an Apple phone (iPhone 15 or 16), an Android phone (Galaxy S23 Ultra), a tablet (M1 iPad Air) and a laptop (16-inch MacBook Pro with the M1 Pro chip). Even though these banks can charge multiple devices at once, I refilled one at a time, to make side-by-side comparisons more straightforward. I drained the batteries of the phones and tablets to between zero and five percent and then didn’t use any device as it refilled.</p> \n<p>For the MacBook, I let it run down to 10 percent before plugging in the power bank. That&#39;s when most laptops give display a “connect to power” warning, as draining any battery to empty will compromise the battery life. I then used it as one might in a mobile office, with a Bluetooth keyboard and mouse, while connected to Wi-Fi and a VPN.</p> \n<p>For each test, I noted how long a completely charged battery took to get a device back to full and how much of the battery’s capacity was used up in one charge. I also noted things like portability, apparent durability, helpful features and overall design.</p> \n<p>For reference, here are the battery capacities of the devices I used:</p> \n<ul> \n <li><p>iPhone 15: 3,349mAh</p></li> \n <li><p>Galaxy S23 Ultra: 4,855mAh</p></li> \n <li><p>iPad Air (5th gen): 7,729mAh</p></li> \n <li><p>16-inch M1 Pro MacBook Pro: 27,027mAh</p></li> \n</ul> \n<h2 id=\"jump-link-other-laptop-power-banks-we-tested\">Other laptop power banks we tested</h2> \n<p><strong>HyperJuice 245W</strong></p> \n<p>Hyper’s <a data-i13n=\"elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Hyper;elmt:;cpos:27;pos:1\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=2c93a509-c37a-4798-b978-795281692d23&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=c803d2c4-bcfe-4f4a-8b7d-1f390c4e3c3d&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Hyper&amp;linkText=HyperJuice+245W&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5oeXBlcnNob3AuY29tL3Byb2R1Y3RzL2h5cGVyanVpY2UtMjQ1dy11c2ItYy1iYXR0ZXJ5LXBhY2siLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6ImM4MDNkMmM0LWJjZmUtNGY0YS04YjdkLTFmMzkwYzRlM2MzZCIsIm9yaWdpbmFsVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuaHlwZXJzaG9wLmNvbS9wcm9kdWN0cy9oeXBlcmp1aWNlLTI0NXctdXNiLWMtYmF0dGVyeS1wYWNrIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAaz3PR-XqcBdnqO82nXy1rrlde5SZd2vCx9OZRQD-8m2&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hypershop.com%2Fproducts%2Fhyperjuice-245w-usb-c-battery-pack\" class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" data-original-link=\"https://www.hypershop.com/products/hyperjuice-245w-usb-c-battery-pack\">HyperJuice 245W</a> brick looks great and has a hefty 27,000mAh capacity.

Phone power banks tend to have a capacity ranging from 5,000mAh to 20,000mAh and laptop powerbanks are typically rated between 20,000mAh and 27,000mAh. There’s no official definition, however. Laptop batteries are simply larger and need a bigger supply of power to give them a meaningful charge.</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-how-do-you-fast-charge-a-power-bank\"><strong>How do you fast charge a power bank?</strong></h3> \n<p>You can charge a power bank exactly as fast as the power bank’s internal mechanisms will allow. Most batteries are limited in how quickly they can accept and deliver a charge to avoid dangerously overheating. But to make sure you’re charging a bank as quickly as possible, make sure the wall adapter and the USB-C cable you are using have a high wattage rating — using a 5W power brick and a 10W cable will take a lot longer to refill your bank than a 65W wall charger and a 100W cord.</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-what-size-power-bank-do-i-need-for-a-laptop\"><strong>What size power bank do I need for a laptop?</strong></h3> \n<p>Look for a power bank with a rating of at least 20,000mAh. Slightly smaller batteries may work, but they won’t deliver a significant charge laptops.</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-how-many-mah-to-charge-a-laptop\"><strong>How many mAh to charge a laptop?</strong></h3> \n<p>A milliamp hour (mAh) is how much a battery can hold, and most portable batteries list their capacity using mAh. If you get a battery rated at 20,000mAh or above, it should be able to charge your laptop.</p> \n<p>Using mAh to discuss laptop batteries can be confusing. Due to differing voltages, you can’t directly compare the mAh ratings of a power bank battery to a laptop battery. Using watt-hours is a better gauge, as <a data-i13n=\"elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Goal Zero;elmt:;cpos:28;pos:1\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=30d072b7-7973-41b4-a737-1ec377f5fbf6&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=c803d2c4-bcfe-4f4a-8b7d-1f390c4e3c3d&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Goal+Zero&amp;linkText=that+calculation&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL2dvYWx6ZXJvLmNvbS9wYWdlcy93YXR0YWdlLWNhbGN1bGF0b3IiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6ImM4MDNkMmM0LWJjZmUtNGY0YS04YjdkLTFmMzkwYzRlM2MzZCIsIm9yaWdpbmFsVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly9nb2FsemVyby5jb20vcGFnZXMvd2F0dGFnZS1jYWxjdWxhdG9yIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAZAoNSNAK2PEx3aooXTpsHfiMd2Y4p7JIDJ0pgc2xQFm&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fgoalzero.com%2Fpages%2Fwattage-calculator\" class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" data-original-link=\"https://goalzero.com/pages/wattage-calculator\">that calculation</a> takes voltage into account.</p> \n<h2 id=\"jump-link-recent-updates\">Recent updates</h2> \n<p><strong>November 2025</strong>: Updated our overall top pick to the Anker Laptop Power bank.

    "title": "The CES companies hoping your brain is the next big thing in computing",
    "body": "<p>At every CES I’ve ever been to, there’s been one or two gadgets promising to boost your mental health. In recent years, the number of companies making forays into this space has grown, and will likely continue to do so in the future. Could it be, much like the number of people wearing heart-monitoring wearables today, everyone will be strapping an EEG to their skulls a decade or so down the line? It’s more likely than you think, so it’s worth asking what these devices are good for, what benefit they could bring, and where does the science end and the hype begin.</p><p>An Electroencephalogram (EEG) is a clinical tool to monitor the electrical activity of our brains. Put very simply, our minds are constantly moving ions around, and when they reach the scalp, it’s possible to measure those ions. By placing electrodes on the scalp, you can record the changes in voltages pushed out by our brains more or less in real time. These voltages are commonly grouped into categories, which are often described as <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"link\" href=\"https://nin.nl/about-the-brain/brain-waves/\" data-i13n=\"cpos:1;pos:1\">brain waves</a>. Each one <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/agricultural-and-biological-sciences/brain-waves\" data-i13n=\"cpos:2;pos:1\">represents</a> a different state of mind: Gamma (hard thinking), Beta (anxious or active), Alpha (relaxed), Theta (creative, or dreaming) and Delta (asleep).&nbsp;</p><p><a target=\"_blank\" class=\"link\" href=\"https://profiles.ucl.ac.uk/2747-karl-friston\" data-i13n=\"cpos:3;pos:1\">Professor Karl Friston</a> at University College London is one of the world’s most influential neuroscientists and an expert in brain imaging. He explained that these technologies can be used to diagnose issues both in the structure and function of the brain. And while there are many technologies which can look at how our brains work, “we’re a long way away from understanding the brain like we understand the heart.” Broadly speaking, EEGs are a fairly simple tool for looking at how our minds work, but they have one benefit over more complex methods such as fMRI (functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging), since they work in real time.</p><p>Consumer-use EEGs are nothing new — in 2011 I tested the <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2011-09-28-zeo-mobile-turns-phones-into-a-sleep-clinic-aids-in-advanced-po.html\" data-i13n=\"cpos:4;pos:1\">Zeo Mobile</a>, a small device which you stuck to your forehead and wore overnight. It monitored how well you slept and sounded an alarm when you were at the top of a sleep cycle, so you woke up pretty easily. It worked well but with one downside: It’s hard to sleep with a hard plastic puck stuck to your forehead.</p><p>EEGs are more recently used as part of brain computer interfaces, or for neurofeedback tools to help you calibrate the quality of your meditation. InteraXon, for instance, makes the <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/wearables/muses-new-wearable-eeg-knows-how-hard-youre-thinking-120041154.html\" data-i13n=\"cpos:5;pos:1\">Muse</a> headbands which will monitor your brain waves, telling you when you shift states. Last year, EEG startup Neurable partnered with Master &amp; Dynamic to launch the <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/neurables-brainwave-tracking-master--dynamic-headphones-tell-you-when-to-take-a-break-120004736.html\" data-i13n=\"cpos:6;pos:1\">MW75S Neuro</a>, a pair of high-end headphones designed to track your focus levels. When your attention starts to wane, the system will alert you, advising you to take a rest with the hope of alleviating burnout.</p><figure><img src=\"https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/eeg-neurablemeditation.jpg\" data-crop-orig-src=\"https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/eeg-neurablemeditation.jpg\" style=\"height:1200px;width:1800px;\" alt=\"Neurable\" data-uuid=\"30ad23d1-6c56-4a60-aec7-95ae6e6ac554\"/><figcaption>Neurable</figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Daniel Cooper for Engadget</div></figure><p>At CES this year, Neurable announced a partnership with HP’s gaming arm HyperX to produce EEG headsets with specific benefits for gamers. As gamers are looking for any way to improve their performance, the company has developed algorithms and training programs to help. You might already know that being in a place of high stress isn’t great for your concentration and focus. Consequently, Neurable research scientist Dr. Alicia Howell-Munson walked me through a system that encourages you to reach a state of calm focus with demonstrable improvements in reaction time and accuracy. It’s a system that was initially designed in partnership with Singapore’s Air Force to help ensure pilots remain in a state of calm focus.&nbsp;</p><p>I sat through this demo myself, initially testing my skills in Aimlabs (a tool people use to test their reflexes) where my accuracy and reaction times were measured. Then, while wearing Neurable’s headset, I had to practice focusing my attention on a galaxy of dots, the greater my focus, the slower and closer together the dots got. That wasn’t an easy process, and it took me nearly five minutes to reach the point where I could push all of the dots to coalesce into a single point on the screen. But, when I had, I retook the shooting gallery, and saw dramatic spikes in my performance. My accuracy increased from 91.3 to 99.1 percent, while my reaction time fell from 623ms to 532ms.&nbsp;</p><figure><img src=\"https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/eeg-nurablehyperx.jpg\" data-crop-orig-src=\"https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/eeg-nurablehyperx.jpg\" style=\"height:1200px;width:1800px;\" alt=\"Neurable HyperX headset\" data-uuid=\"faf3e60d-a791-4a8b-8e58-e2c86e36f5dc\"/><figcaption>Neurable HyperX headset</figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Daniel Cooper for Engadget</div></figure><p>Neurable believes that its systems, which are designed to integrate with any manufacturer’s gear, has the potential to dramatically increase a person’s brain health and productivity. For instance, by taking a break when a person’s focus started to wane, they were able to bounce back and function for far longer than if they’d simply pushed harder. Similarly, the company can advise on your cognitive speed and brain age and guide you toward making healthy choices. The company says that this isn’t just about wellness, either, as being able to identify loss of focus is vital, for instance, to help reduce auto accidents when truck drivers feel fatigued.&nbsp;</p><p>Co-founder Adam Molnar explained that the benefits of this technology compound over time, so the more practice a user has in finding that mental state of calm focus, the easier it will be to maintain it for longer. CEO Ramses Alcaide added the company’s aim is to enable people to visualize the often invisible symptoms of cognitive stress to ensure they’re looking after themselves. He added that one thing that separates Neurable from other companies is that it’s looking at far finer-grain detail from its EEG data.&nbsp;</p><figure><img src=\"https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/eeg-mywaves.jpg\" data-crop-orig-src=\"https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/eeg-mywaves.jpg\" style=\"height:1013px;width:1800px;\" alt=\"MyWaves\" data-uuid=\"6a5c70c7-2b45-4ad2-ab44-94cadc3beb6f\"/><figcaption>MyWaves</figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Daniel Cooper for Engadget</div></figure><p>There are plenty of companies at CES that are using EEGs for more specific goals, such as <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"link\" href=\"https://mywaves.tech/\" data-i13n=\"cpos:7;pos:1\">MyWaves</a>. It uses an EEG as part of its broader offering to use sound patterns to make it easier to go to sleep. It sells you a pricey forehead-worn EEG which you wear for a few nights over the course of a year. From there, the system produces a half hour audio file that will mirror the pattern of your delta brainwaves. It claims that, if you listen to the track before you go to bed, the experience of hearing your delta waves will help you fall asleep faster and experience more REM sleep.</p><p>And there are plenty of companies which are building EEGs for you to wear to keep an eye on your mental health. Brain-Life, for instance, showed off an early prototype of Focus+, a headband EEG with a companion app that can offer feedback on your cognitive load. It can also tell you how long you can sustain your attention and how well your mind relaxes and recovers. The company didn’t have details on when the hardware would be available or how much it cost, as it’s still early days.</p><figure><img src=\"https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/eeg-braineulink.jpg\" data-crop-orig-src=\"https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/eeg-braineulink.jpg\" style=\"height:1013px;width:1800px;\" alt=\"BrainEULink.\" data-uuid=\"e4c2dc73-4c20-444b-a63b-57fe79c0cfac\"/><figcaption>BrainEULink.</figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Daniel Cooper for Engadget</div></figure><p>There is broad potential to use an EEG as a brain computer interface, such as the one worked on by Braineulink. That company has combined an EEG with an AR headset to enable people to interact with the world just with their brains. For instance, in a demonstration in the show floor at CES, I was able to turn a light on and off by “focusing” on it, although it’s hard to know how useful that would be in, for instance, creating an assistive device for folks with limited mobility. Like Brain-Life, it’s early days, and so there’s no product that we can point to, but it’s clear we’re going to see more startups looking to enter this world.&nbsp;</p><figure><img src=\"https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/eeg-brainlife.jpg\" data-crop-orig-src=\"https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/eeg-brainlife.jpg\" style=\"height:1013px;width:1800px;\" alt=\"Brain-Life\" data-uuid=\"8e00a0f7-f339-4ff2-b4f3-d7715ddd928b\"/><figcaption>Brain-Life</figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Daniel Cooper for Engadget</div></figure><p>As EEGs become more commonplace, it’s likely they’ll be packaged in smaller devices which fit more seamlessly into our lives. One such example is NAOX, a French startup which has built a wearable, clinical-grade EEG into a pair of earbuds for the sort of longitudinal testing required to diagnose conditions like epilepsy. But the company is also planning on incorporating the technology into a pair of true wireless earbuds.These headphones won’t be arriving until the end of 2026, but Naox says the tech is small enough that it can be integrated with other companies earbuds. Consequently, it’s certainly plausible we could see plenty of earbuds that will keep an eye on our brain health as a side hustle.&nbsp;</p><figure><img src=\"https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/eeg-naoxclinical.jpg\" data-crop-orig-src=\"https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/eeg-naoxclinical.jpg\" style=\"height:1013px;width:1800px;\" alt=\"Naox\" data-uuid=\"09b9102c-62ab-4c72-8f85-cd0bfd2d0408\"/><figcaption>Naox</figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Daniel Cooper for Engadget</div></figure><p>NAOX was co-founded by Dr. Michel Le Van Quyen who, <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKhpC2qijQA\" data-i13n=\"cpos:8;pos:1\">at a talk in London in December 2025</a>, talked about the rationale for creating an in-ear ECG. Essentially, he was looking to build a brain equivalent to the Apple Watch’s continuous heart rate monitoring (and ECG). I was curious about the science behind an ear-mounted EEG given they commonly use the scalp. Professor Friston said that an ear-mounted EEG is potentially more useful as “you can get slightly closer to the sources of activity.” And that it makes a lot of sense for a consumer-grade EEG to be added to wireless earbuds given their utility in practices like meditation.</p><figure><img src=\"https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/eeg-naoxtws.jpg\" data-crop-orig-src=\"https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/eeg-naoxtws.jpg\" style=\"height:1013px;width:1800px;\" alt=\"Naox&#39;s prototype TWS earbuds sensors.\" data-uuid=\"57ea4c48-a263-4b21-a655-64e6ccbeafcd\"/><figcaption>Naox&#39;s prototype TWS earbuds sensors.</figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Daniel Cooper for Engadget</div></figure><p>One downside of the proliferation of wearable EEGs is that it could lead users to jump to the wrong conclusions about their mental health. For instance, if someone is to be diagnosed with a condition such as epilepsy, they need to undergo a 24-hour perambulatory EEG. As Professor Friston explained, the recording of that 24 hour EEG would be “carefully scrutinized by experts who are able to run a differential diagnosis ... to specify what further investigations are required.” He, like a lot of clinicians, is concerned about ill-informed consumers using these devices to make medical interventions without consulting a professional.&nbsp;</p><p>Friston added that people shouldn’t expect wearable EEGs to be magic bullets for their brain health or cognition. He said the best way for a consumer to approach them is by treating them with the same level of reverence as a household thermometer. “Are thermometers useful in managing the wellness of my children?, Yes,” he explained, “can your thermometer tell you what particular virus you have? Absolutely not.” “In the context of well-being and to augment or validate practices such as mindfulness and meditation, they can be fun and useful quantitative devices.” But, fundamentally, that is all he feels they can be, especially right now.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/wearables/the-ces-companies-hoping-your-brain-is-the-next-big-thing-in-computing-175048601.html?src=rss",

On almost any VPN, this is a simple matter of opening the app or desktop client and choosing the server location from a list.</p><figure><img src=\"https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/Proton_VPN_Mac_interface.png\" data-crop-orig-src=\"https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/Proton_VPN_Mac_interface.png\" style=\"height:1872px;width:3407px;\" alt=\"On Proton VPN, for example, you can switch locations by clicking the name of any country in the list on the left.\" data-uuid=\"c0ecfb77-d3b2-4d75-b95e-1db966e6c94e\"/><figcaption>On Proton VPN, for example, you can switch locations by clicking the name of any country in the list on the left.</figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Sam Chapman for Engadget</div></figure><p>However, as with any technology, there are some potential pitfalls. For reference, I&#39;ve laid out the steps below for both desktop and mobile devices.</p><h3 id=\"jump-link-how-to-change-location-on-windows-or-mac\"><strong>How to change location on Windows or Mac</strong></h3><p>Use these steps to change the virtual location of any desktop or laptop device running macOS or Windows. There may be slight variations, but in general, this process works for any top VPN.</p><ol><li><p>Select a VPN provider. You can rely on Engadget&#39;s best VPN list or, if you&#39;re unable to pay for a new subscription right now, our list of the <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/best-free-vpn-120032818.html\" data-i13n=\"cpos:4;pos:1\">best free VPNs</a>. My personal choice is <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/proton-vpn-review-2025-a-nonprofit-service-with-premium-performance-153046073.html\" data-i13n=\"cpos:5;pos:1\">Proton VPN</a>, but there are other good options. Look for a service with fast speeds, modern encryption and a long, non-controversial record in the industry.</p></li><li><p>Create an account with the VPN and save your username and password. Unless it&#39;s a forever-free service, this is when you&#39;ll be asked to pay for a subscription. If you&#39;re sure about your provider, you can save a lot by going with a long-term deal. See our list of the <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/deals/the-best-vpn-deals-up-to-88-percent-off-protonvpn-surfshark-expressvpn-nordvpn-and-more-120056445.html\" data-i13n=\"cpos:6;pos:1\">best VPN deals</a> for ideas.</p></li><li><p>Download the VPN app. It&#39;s best to go through the VPN&#39;s website, even if you&#39;re on Mac — in rare cases, the App Store versions can be outdated or short on features. Look for a download center on the site, and make sure you enter it while logged in.</p></li><li><p>Install the VPN app. Most VPNs have an installation flow built in, so all you have to do is follow the steps. If the VPN asks you to change your settings or grant it permissions, do it; this installs the tools it needs to do its job.</p></li><li><p>Open the VPN app and find your way around the user interface. At a minimum, make sure you know how to connect, disconnect and open the location selection menu.</p></li><li><p>Connect to a server in the location where you want your internet connection to appear to originate. If you&#39;re trying to get around local restrictions, you can just pick any nearby country without that censorship — for example, if you&#39;re in China, then Japan, South Korea or Singapore will work. If you&#39;re after content from a specific country, choose a server in that country.</p></li><li><p>Get online through a browser or connected app as you normally would. To make sure your location has actually changed, use a site like <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"link\" href=\"https://whatismyipaddress.com/\" data-i13n=\"cpos:7;pos:1\">WhatIsMyIPAddress</a> to check where you&#39;re coming from.</p></li><li><p>When you want to use your real location again, disconnect from the VPN or choose a server in the county you&#39;re in.</p></li></ol><p>It&#39;s not necessary, but I also recommend activating your VPN&#39;s kill switch if there is one. VPN servers aren&#39;t perfect, and they do drop connections from time to time. If this happens, an active kill switch also cuts off your internet connection so your real location isn&#39;t visible for a millisecond.</p><h3 id=\"jump-link-how-to-change-location-on-iphone-or-android\"><strong>How to change location on iPhone or Android</strong></h3><p>The process for using a VPN to change your virtual location on mobile is pretty similar to how it&#39;s done on desktop. Again, while individual installation flows have their own quirks, the following steps are broadly applicable to any iOS or Android VPN.</p><ol><li><p>Pick a VPN provider you like. The best VPNs also tend to be the best for mobile, including Proton VPN, <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/vpn-review-expressvpn-2023-gaming-streaming-160052492.html\" data-i13n=\"cpos:8;pos:1\">ExpressVPN</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/surfshark-vpn-review-a-fast-vpn-for-casual-users-170022675.html\" data-i13n=\"cpos:9;pos:1\">Surfshark</a>. On mobile, you can use app store reviews and comments to research. Make sure you&#39;re getting the real version of your chosen VPN and not a similarly named one trying to piggyback.</p></li><li><p>Download the VPN from the Apple App Store or Google Play Store. At this point, if you haven&#39;t paid yet, you may be able to take advantage of a free trial by opening the app and proceeding through the setup flow. This is a good time to test if the VPN is changing your location in ways that can&#39;t be seen through.</p></li><li><p>Follow the VPN&#39;s instructions to create an account, including paying for a subscription if necessary.</p></li><li><p>Take some time to learn to use the VPN app. Mobile interfaces have to pack more features into a smaller space, usually relying on tabs. Try and find the tabs for picking server locations and toggling VPN settings.</p></li><li><p>Connect to a server in your desired location. Make sure the VPN is actually active before you proceed (most of them make it pretty clear, but it&#39;s still easy to forget).</p></li><li><p>Get online through a browser or another internet-capable app.</p></li><li><p>When you&#39;re finished, disconnect from the VPN to return to using your real location.</p></li></ol><p>One more note: on both mobile and desktop, I recommend using either a paid VPN or a free VPN supported by a paid subscription. Entirely free VPNs <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/vpns-are-booming-in-the-uk-after-age-restriction-laws-but-free-options-carry-big-risks-060036636.html\" data-i13n=\"cpos:10;pos:1\">come with risks</a>, and some popular apps <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/researchers-find-alarming-overlaps-among-18-popular-vpns-191828342.html\" data-i13n=\"cpos:11;pos:1\">secretly share problematic connections</a>.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=\"jump-link-why-change-your-virtual-location\"><strong>Why change your virtual location?</strong></h2><p>Changing your virtual location isn&#39;t hard, but it&#39;s still an extra step between you and the internet. However, the benefits of location masking far outweigh the small amount of extra work. Hiding your IP address — and your location along with it — is one of the most impactful <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/12-steps-you-can-take-right-now-to-be-safer-online-130008335.html\" data-i13n=\"cpos:12;pos:1\">steps you can take to stay safe online</a>.</p><p>Concealing your IP address has massive benefits on its own, even if you use one close to your real location (which gets you shorter loading times). Lots of web services track you without your consent, frequently for advertising purposes. Some of this is done through third-party cookies, but a lot of it starts with building profiles about your IP address.</p><p>Illicit actors can also take advantage of your IP address and its geolocation. A hacker can track you down to within your ZIP code — though an IP address can&#39;t pinpoint your location to the square foot, it makes it much easier to narrow down where you live. Even with just your IP address, hackers can launch DDoS attacks against you, use the IP to make fake social media accounts in your name or even call in <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/miffed-rainbow-six-seige-player-sentenced-for-swatting-ubisoft-montreals-offices-201200746.html\" data-i13n=\"cpos:13;pos:1\">SWAT teams to your location</a>.</p><figure><img src=\"https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/ExpressVPN_Netflix_UK.png\" data-crop-orig-src=\"https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/ExpressVPN_Netflix_UK.png\" style=\"height:1537px;width:3038px;\" alt=\"By changing my location to the UK using ExpressVPN, I can see shows on Netflix that aren&#39;t listed in the US.\" data-uuid=\"6448824f-e64b-4d18-8249-23db20dc5ddd\"/><figcaption>By changing my location to the UK using ExpressVPN, I can see shows on Netflix that aren&#39;t listed in the US.</figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Sam Chapman for Engadget</div></figure><p>Although masking your virtual location can be vital to staying safe online, there are other practical and even fun reasons to do it. For one thing, when traveling abroad, you might want to use a site only available in your home country. Simply connect to a server located near home and you can use your bank account and local streaming libraries as normal.</p><p>If you&#39;re home, there are lots of benefits to being virtually in another region. You can see a foreign country&#39;s streaming libraries and shop for deals that may only be available in its currency. You can also get around any nationwide online censorship and potentially download banned apps. Just be sure to be aware of your local laws to know if doing so is merely frowned upon, or if it’s truly against the law.</p><h2 id=\"jump-link-can-a-vpn-change-your-gps-location\"><strong>Can a VPN change your GPS location?</strong></h2><p>There&#39;s one more critical point to remember when changing location with a VPN. The VPN server only changes your IP address and the physical location associated with it. It does not change the GPS location your device might be broadcasting.</p><p>GPS data can leak out in a few ways. Tablets and phones have location services turned on by default, and as anyone who&#39;s heard a true crime podcast knows, they can also give away your location by contacting cell towers. Web browsers often have similar features. Websites can also use HTML5 geolocation to access your GPS — provided you give permission, but that&#39;s easy to do without thinking.</p><p>Some VPNs, including Surfshark and Windscribe, do have features designed to fool GPS, but they&#39;re not standard. When you&#39;re changing your location with a VPN, make sure to turn off location services and avoid granting any permissions that might reveal where you really are. You can also run a separate GPS spoofing app alongside your VPN.</p><h2 id=\"jump-link-how-to-troubleshoot-a-vpn-thats-not-changing-your-location\"><strong>How to troubleshoot a VPN that&#39;s not changing your location</strong></h2><p>If you&#39;ve found that browsers are still seeing your old IP address while you have a VPN active, or that websites show you the same content when you&#39;re supposed to be virtually abroad, there&#39;s a chance your VPN isn&#39;t actually changing your location. To test if your real position is leaking, start by checking your IP address (with a search engine or WhatIsMyIPAddress). If it matches your home location, something has gone wrong.</p><p>Note that it&#39;s not necessarily a problem if it doesn&#39;t match your home location or the stated location of your VPN server. VPNs use virtual server locations to reach a lot of locations where brick-and-mortar servers aren&#39;t practical — Windscribe, for example, does not have a physical data center in Antarctica.</p><p>If you find that your VPN is leaking your real IP address, try these troubleshooting steps in order. I&#39;ve arranged them roughly from least to most time-intensive.</p><ol><li><p>Disconnect from your VPN and reconnect to the same location. This should hook you up with a different server in that same place. Test your IP again — there&#39;s a good chance the problem was isolated to the first server you tried.</p></li><li><p>Try a new location (skip this step if you need a server in a particular country).</p></li><li><p>Try a different VPN protocol. If you&#39;re using WireGuard, switch to OpenVPN or IKEv2.</p></li><li><p>Make sure location services are turned off.</p></li><li><p>Clear your browser cache and cookies to get rid of any saved information.</p></li><li><p>Test for DNS leaks. Your VPN might accidentally be sending your IP address to a public server to resolve DNS requests. <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"link\" href=\"http://IPleak.org\" data-i13n=\"cpos:14;pos:1\"><a target=\"_blank\" class=\"link\">IPleak.org</a></a> is a good tool for catching this.</p></li><li><p>Try a different VPN. Use a free service like Proton or Windscribe and test for leaks. If the problem reoccurs, it might be coming from inside your network.</p></li><li><p>Contact the helpdesk for your original VPN and inform them about the problem. Get screenshots of the VPN connected to the leaky location next to IP address data confirming the leak.</p></li></ol><p>I&#39;ve already mentioned several VPNs that do a good job of changing your location, but in case you&#39;re here for product advice, here are all my recommendations in one place. My favorite VPN is <strong>Proton VPN,</strong> which is so far the only service to receive full marks on my location-change test. I used 15 of its servers in five different countries to access Netflix. Each time, I saw the destination country&#39;s full content library like I was really there.</p><p><strong>Surfshark </strong>is a close runner-up in this category. It passed 14 out of 15 tests, only slipping up once in Japan — and a quick disconnect and reconnect was enough to fix that. I got equally great results from <strong>ExpressVPN</strong>, only having to retry one server in the UK. <strong>NordVPN </strong>performed perfectly in every location except Nigeria, and that still didn&#39;t leak my real IP address. The problem only seemed to exist on Netflix.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/how-to-change-location-with-a-vpn-140000339.html?src=rss",

This is the first time in its history that the space agency is cutting a mission short due to a medical issue, but it didn’t identify the crew member or divulge the exact situation and its severity. The agency is targeting a return date no earlier than January 14, with the exact schedule depending on the weather. If NASA’s original plan pushes through, the crew will splash down off the coast of California at approximately 3:40 AM on January 15.</p><p>The agency previously <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/science/space/nasa-delays-spacewalk-due-to-a-medical-concern-with-a-crew-member-171900024.html\" data-i13n=\"cpos:3;pos:1\">postponed</a> an International Space Station (ISS) spacewalk scheduled for January 8, citing a medical concern with a crew member that appeared the day before. NASA’s chief health and medical officer, James “JD” Polk, said the affected astronaut is “absolutely stable” and that this isn’t a case of an emergency evacuation. The ISS has a “robust suite of medical hardware” onboard, he said, but not enough for a complete workup to determine a diagnosis. Without a proper diagnosis, NASA doesn’t know if the astronaut’s health could be negatively affected by the environment aboard the ISS. That is why the agency is erring on the side of caution. </p><p>Crew-11 left for the space station on August 1 and was supposed to come back to Earth on or around February 20. After they leave the station, only three people will remain: Two cosmonauts and one astronauts who’ll be in charge of all the experiments currently being conducted on the orbiting lab. The team’s replacement, Crew-12, was supposed to head to the ISS mid-February, but NASA is considering sending the astronauts to the station earlier than that. </p><p><strong>Update, January 10, 2025, 5:15AM ET: </strong>This story has been updated to include Crew-11’s tentative return date.</p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/science/space/nasa-is-ending-crew-11-astronauts-mission-a-month-early-140000750.html?src=rss",

The week began with press conferences from huge companies at the show, mostly filled with AI buzzwords, vague promises and quite little in the way of hard news.</p><p>More than one company even decided to forgo announcing things during their conferences to make way for more AI chatter, only to publish press releases later quietly admitting that, yes, actually, they did make some consumer technology. It&#39;s appropriate, I guess, that as we&#39;re beginning to feel the knock-on cost effects of the AI industry&#39;s insatiable appetite for compute resources — higher utility bills and device prices — companies would rather use their flashy conferences to reinforce AI&#39;s supposedly must-have attributes rather than actually inform the public about their new products.</p><p>We&#39;re by no means AI luddites at Engadget, but it&#39;s fair to say that our team is more excited by tangible products that enrich our lives than iterative improvements to large language models.

Without the app, it relies on a smaller local model for transcription.</p><p>While we still need to put the Voicebuds through their paces, they’re intriguing because we haven’t seen many genuinely useful AI hardware products. Plus, it’s been a while since we’ve seen a tiny startup deliver hardware trying to take on the likes of Apple. <em>— Devindra Hardawar, Senior reporter</em></p><h2 id=\"jump-link-best-smart-home-ikea-matter-compatible-smart-home\">Best smart home: IKEA Matter-compatible smart home</h2><figure><img src=\"https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/ikeabestof2.jpg\" data-crop-orig-src=\"https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/ikeabestof2.jpg\" style=\"height:720px;width:1280px;\" alt=\"IKEA KAJPLATS smart bulb range\" data-uuid=\"dd8ca7bb-3589-4016-bf54-206a0ff13b3b\" data-display-size=\"standard\"><figcaption>IKEA KAJPLATS smart bulb range</figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">IKEA</div></figure><p>The best smart home devices I saw at CES had nothing to do with AI or robots.

Function paired with accessible pricing is sort of what IKEA is known for, so the lineup didn’t exactly surprise me as much as make me appreciate that someone is finally simplifying and democratizing smart home stuff.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>There are 21 Matter-compatible devices in all. They include a $6 smart bulb, an $8 smart plug, a $6 smart remote and a slew of home sensors. A slightly pricier ($15) globe bulb looks very lovely. Finally, there’s a smart bulb you’d actually want to look at — one that doesn’t cost $50. Another standout is the BILREA remote control. Not only is it an intuitive controller for IKEA’s smart devices and new smart lamps, it also has a magnetic mount so you don’t lose the thing. Matter devices require a hub to function. Here, you can either go for IKEA’s own <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/ai/how-to-watch-todays-bosch-ces-2026-press-conference-live-130020554.html\" data-i13n=\"cpos:11;pos:1\">DIRIGERA</a> or use a Matter hub you already own.

They also have a tiny speaker that further helps bring Lego builds to life.&nbsp;</p><p>The Smart Brick is mostly a blank slate, but pairing it with Lego&#39;s Smart Tags and Smart Minifigures is what enables these new play scenarios. Unsurprisingly, Lego introduced the Smart Play system alongside Star Wars sets that make these new immersive elements more obvious. An X-Wing piloted by Luke Skywalker can get into a dogfight with Darth Vader&#39;s TIE fighter, and you&#39;ll hear the engines roar to life, the characters exclaim as they come under fire and the spaceship explodes if it gets hit too many times. And Smart Play requires no setup, meaning that the technology packed into the Smart Brick fades away and lets kids (and kids at heart) get down to the business of playing.

The ability of each part to detect and interact with others can lead to some ridiculous setups, whether it’s ducks and police officers or a helicopter or an X-Wing.</p>\n<p>Naturally, it’s a little pricier than basic Lego, but not out of the realm of being a special gift or birthday present. One of the first sets, with a smart Darth Vader Minifigure, one Smart Brick and one Smart Tag, is $70.</p>\n<p>We&#39;ll be back to our regularly scheduled newsletter next week.

But if you went looking for sustainability products, you’re going to have to hunt a bit. </p><p>Last year, the Sustainability section at the Las Vegas Convention Center had 20 booths.

So exhibitors like South Korea’s largest electric utility company, a nuclear power company from the same country and lots of battery manufacturers. There was also an AI data platform booth in the section that had nothing to do with sustainability as far as I can tell. Guess the organizers just ran out of room for all the AI. </p><p>Within the sustainability section, and at other CES venues, I found a few encouraging displays of sustainable products — organizations and devices that were trying to address the <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/the-us-withdraws-from-dozens-of-international-bodies-including-climate-focused-organizations-195259578.html\" data-i13n=\"cpos:5;pos:1\">multitude of problems</a> the world is facing when it comes to energy production, climate and pollution. </p><p>But none of it quite achieved Engadget’s <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/engadgets-best-of-ces-2026-all-the-new-tech-that-caught-our-eye-in-las-vegas-200057123.html\" data-i13n=\"cpos:6;pos:1\">best of CES</a> status this year. Some of what we saw was utility-scale, some wasn’t quite ready for consumer consumption and other stuff was too niche or had too many caveats to make the list. I won’t go so far as to say sustainability is dead at CES, because that sends me into dark downward spirals, but it’s getting sparse out there, friends. </p><p>Here are the companies I saw that had promise and innovative ideas.

This small company has two solutions to create energy for buildings by harnessing the potential energy from existing systems. HydroVigor generates power from water systems. So every time someone washes their hands or flushes a toilet in a building, the roof-top system generates a bit of power. CoolVigor uses the same principles to harness energy from HVAC systems.

    "title": "The Clicks co-founder explains who its tiny Communicator phone is for",
    "body": "<p>Clicks is an apologetically gadgety company, making gear that <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/clicks-hands-on-a-charming-keyboard-for-2024-thats-relying-on-more-than-just-nostalgia-131537619.html\" data-i13n=\"cpos:1;pos:1\">feels charmingly out-of-place</a> in a world where almost every smartphone out there is an all-screen slab. That was obviously two years ago when the company first revealed its keyboard case that brought tactile typing to the iPhone and eventually other Android devices. Rather than that being a one-off curiosity, the company had <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/clicks-is-bringing-its-first-smartphone-and-a-new-keyboard-to-ces-2026-182239003.html\" data-i13n=\"cpos:2;pos:1\">two new announcements</a> at CES 2026: a magnetic keyboard accessory that also doubles as a battery bank and small, squat mobile phone with a keyboard. And while there isn’t a working prototype of the Clicks Communicator available for the press to see, I got to check out the new Power Keyboard talk with Clicks co-founder and former BlackBerry marketing director Jeff Gadway about where he thinks his products fit into the smartphone world.</p><p>At first glance, the $79 Power Keyboard feels like a big improvement over the original Clicks Keyboard case. It magnetically attaches to any phone with Qi2 and connects over Bluetooth. The keyboard itself is similar to the original Clicks keyboard, but there’s a dedicated number row which is a nice improvement. But the thing that really caught my eye was its old-school slider form factor. When closed, the Power Keyboard sits on the back of your phone like a thick wireless battery pack — but it satisfyingly slides up to reveal the keyboard like the Palm Pre or BlackBerry Torch smartphones of old. </p><figure><img src=\"https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/DSCF9191.jpg\" data-crop-orig-src=\"https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/DSCF9191.jpg\" style=\"height:1350px;width:2400px;\" alt=\"The magnetic, sliding Clicks Power Keyboard.\" data-uuid=\"0ce88f11-8353-414f-af2a-31e90ceac187\"><figcaption>The magnetic, sliding Clicks Power Keyboard.</figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Nathan Ingraham for Engadget</div></figure><p>The Power Keyboard’s last trick is that it can charge your phone up when attached. The battery itself isn’t huge, so you’re not going to fully recharge a modern smartphone. But it’s still a nice addition for if you need some power in a pinch. You can also set it up so it doesn’t charge your phone and instead uses all the battery to power the keyboard; in that situation, the keyboard will last weeks without a charge. Or you can designate a percentage that can only be used by the keyboard — for example, if the battery pack’s charge drops below 20 percent, it’ll stop charging your phone and instead save that power for the keyboard.</p><figure><img src=\"https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/DSCF9209.jpg\" data-crop-orig-src=\"https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/DSCF9209.jpg\" style=\"height:1350px;width:2400px;\" alt=\"The Clicks Power Keyboard, without a phone attached.\" data-uuid=\"d7e2775d-42b4-4516-ab1c-fc8d809e1e93\"><figcaption>The Clicks Power Keyboard, without a phone attached.</figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Nathan Ingraham for Engadget</div></figure><p>As someone who has never owned a smartphone with a keyboard, I can’t say how good the Clicks keyboard actually is — there would be a definite learning curve before I got comfortable with it. It certainly feels tiny to me, but if you just type on and trust autocorrect you should get the hang of it before too long. Whether the benefits of using a physical keyboard matter are up to you to decide. It’s nice seeing a bigger screen unobstructed by the virtual keyboard, but I feel far too set in my touchscreen ways to consider switching it up. But some people just loved their keyboards, and for them this gadget might hit the spot.</p><p>The Clicks Communicator is the more unexpected of the two new devices the comapny is working on, but without a working demo model I can’t render any judgement about how it will actually work. When it was announced, Clicks specifically said they were targeting people who used multiple devices, a demographic that I wasn’t fully convinced was large enough to justify the Communicator’s existence. But Gadway assured me the company had done plenty of research before moving into the hardware production phase. </p><p>“You&#39;ve got people who are mandated to carry a second device for corporate deploy. Then you&#39;ve got people who are small business owners and want to have a separate phone for their small business,” he said. “In markets like Europe, there&#39;s a requirement for employers to give people the option to have a separate device and create more separation. You&#39;ve got travelers who want a second SIM, and then you&#39;ve got this growing cohort of digital detox, digital minimalism, digital well-being people.” None of those segments might be huge on its own, but add it all up and the Clicks team felt like they had a decent opportunity. </p><figure><img src=\"https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/DSCF9236.jpg\" data-crop-orig-src=\"https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/DSCF9236.jpg\" style=\"height:1350px;width:2400px;\" alt=\"The Clicks Communicator has an LED Light on its side button that you can customize for different notifications.\" data-uuid=\"383d6067-92af-4f84-ac04-08018df735a3\"><figcaption>The Clicks Communicator has an LED Light on its side button that you can customize for different notifications.</figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Nathan Ingraham for Engadget</div></figure><p>The other half of the thought process was making the Communicator different from an iPhone or Pixel — instead of having two essentially identical devices, Clicks wanted to make the Communicator with a distinct focus. “Our thought process was that complementary devices in tech are on the rise,’ Gadway said. “You wear an Oura Ring and you wear a smart watch; you carry an e-reader for reading and a tablet for content consumption. So why shouldn&#39;t your second phone be better at certain things than your first phone instead of just being a straight duplicate?”</p><p>That’s where the squarish, 4-inch touchscreen, keyboard and custom implementation of <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"link rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=b747fd19-ae32-4fad-ae62-84f9d8942106&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;linkText=the+Niagara+Android+launcher&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3BsYXkuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS9zdG9yZS9hcHBzL2RldGFpbHM_aWQ9Yml0cGl0LmxhdW5jaGVyJmhsPWVuX1VTIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJiNzQ3ZmQxOS1hZTMyLTRmYWQtYWU2Mi04NGY5ZDg5NDIxMDYiLCJvcmlnaW5hbFVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vcGxheS5nb29nbGUuY29tL3N0b3JlL2FwcHMvZGV0YWlscz9pZD1iaXRwaXQubGF1bmNoZXImaGw9ZW5fVVMifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAVzMyKyse3TDKidO_Oy2Ej2eR8LRmly8IFYzm1Y2whhd&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fplay.google.com%2Fstore%2Fapps%2Fdetails%3Fid%3Dbitpit.launcher%26hl%3Den_US\" data-i13n=\"elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:;cpos:3;pos:1\" data-original-link=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=bitpit.launcher&amp;hl=en_US\">the Niagara Android launcher</a>, which is a list-based UI rather than a grid of apps. The custom Clicks implementation of it focuses on your messaging apps and quickly triaging through new items (hence the Communicator name). The keyboard itself is touch sensitive and can be swiped across to navigate and take actions on what you see. But the Communicator is just an Android phone at heart which means you can install any apps that you find essential — though its form factor changes what it is best used for. “You can download whatever apps you want, but we&#39;ve optimized it to be better at specific things,” Gadway said. “So, you know, do you want to watch letterboxed TikTok videos on this? Probably not. You could, but it&#39;s not the thing you&#39;re going to reach for to do that. But we&#39;re not going to give you a product that restricts what you can do.”</p><p>The good thing about being a smaller hardware maker is that Clicks doesn’t need to sell millions of these — they’re just interested in offering an alternative for people who might enjoy it, just as they’ve done with their keyboard accessories. Of course, the Communicator is a bigger investment; it’s up for pre-order now for $399 (that’s Pixel 9a territory, for comparison). Once it launches in the second half of the year, we’ll find out if it can find its audience. </p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/the-clicks-co-founder-explains-who-its-tiny-communicator-phone-is-for-170000501.html?src=rss",

Using what Lego calls the “Play Engine” and integrated copper coils, each brick can sense things like motion, orientation and magnetic fields, plus its own distance, direction and orientation in relation to other Smart Bricks. Each brick also has a teeny tiny speaker built in that will play audio “tied to live play actions” rather than only pre-recorded clips.</p><p>Accompanying Smart Bricks are Smart Tags and Smart Minifigures, which have their own capabilities — one of which is letting Smart Bricks know what context they are being used in. All of these pieces tie together via a local wireless layer dubbed BrickNet that, in part, lets Smart Bricks know where they are placed in relation to other smart components. </p><p>The first “<a target=\"_blank\" class=\"link rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=70bceed8-b1ae-4af0-9fde-faa9258e1bc8&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=fd3b4bbf-1b78-4e34-9914-70a2e6f85389&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=LEGO&amp;linkText=Smart+Play&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5sZWdvLmNvbS9lbi11cy9zbWFydC1wbGF5IiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJmZDNiNGJiZi0xYjc4LTRlMzQtOTkxNC03MGEyZTZmODUzODkiLCJvcmlnaW5hbFVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ28uY29tL2VuLXVzL3NtYXJ0LXBsYXkifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAUtpF6P2TEsufMRmdxeGT4PbJA8qivZgoVfsF5cuft7l&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lego.com%2Fen-us%2Fsmart-play\" data-i13n=\"elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:LEGO;elmt:;slk:Smart Play;cpos:8;pos:1\" data-original-link=\"https://www.lego.com/en-us/smart-play\">Smart Play</a>” partner is, unsurprisingly, Star Wars, which will unleash three “all-in-one” sets using Smart Bricks, Smart Tags and Smart Minifigures.

The UltraSharp 52 Thunderbolt Hub Monitor has a nifty feature, in that it&#39;s possible to hook up four PCs simultaneously and have a dedicated section of the display for each. That could make co-op games pretty fun if you&#39;re dedicated enough to try that setup. You can control all four connected PCs with a single mouse and keyboard too.

At $369, that seems like a pretty decent option if you’re looking for an entry-level projector you can take anywhere. The P1i should arrive in time for summer camping trips, since Soundcore says it’ll be available in the early part of this year.

Given current conversion rates from UK prices, the Speedster will start at around $100,000 and the Roadster at roughly $75,000, and that’s <em>before</em> factoring in costs such as tariffs.</p><figure><img src=\"https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/Segway-Muxi-ebike-lifestyle-2.jpg\" data-crop-orig-src=\"https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/Segway-Muxi-ebike-lifestyle-2.jpg\" style=\"height:5464px;width:8192px;\" alt=\"Muxi\" data-uuid=\"86d61664-366b-44f6-87b7-62c3c0830829\"><figcaption>Muxi</figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Segway</div></figure><p>Segway is <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/transportation/segway-launches-two-more-e-bikes-at-ces-130000152.html\" data-i13n=\"cpos:94;pos:1\">expanding</a> its e-bike lineup with two new models that have a heap of smart features, from Apple Find My integration and GPS tracking to remote locking and health app functions. The Muxi looks quite pretty and it has a cup holder (love that), while the $2,000 Myon has a chunkier frame and features such as electronic gear shifting. Both are cargo-centric step-through models. You can buy the Myon now, and the $1,700 Muxi will be available in March, just in time for spring.</p><p>Along with those e-bikes, Segway had a new electric dirt bike to tell us about. The Xaber 300 was created with off-roading in mind. There are three power modes, offering the equivalent of 150cc, 200cc and 300cc engines. Segway hasn’t revealed pricing for the Xaber 300, which should be available this spring or summer.</p><h2 id=\"jump-link-gaming\">Gaming&nbsp;</h2><figure><img src=\"https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/NVIDIA_DLSS_4.5.jpg\" data-crop-orig-src=\"https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/NVIDIA_DLSS_4.5.jpg\" style=\"height:1080px;width:1920px;\" alt=\"Slide from NVIDIA&amp;#39;s CES 2026 presentation about DLSS 4.5\" data-uuid=\"fd4c3817-7319-4200-b823-14d7c548c73c\"><figcaption>Slide from NVIDIA&#39;s CES 2026 presentation about DLSS 4.5</figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">NVIDIA</div></figure><p>NVIDIA <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nvidia-announces-dlss-45-at-ces-2026-053000128.html\" data-i13n=\"cpos:95;pos:1\">announced</a> the latest version of its DLSS (Deep Learning Super Sampling) upscaling tech.

It says that G-Sync Pulsar can minimize motion blur by effectively quadrupling your refresh rate. So 250Hz gameplay will seemingly offer up a perceived effective motion clarity of over 1,000Hz with G-Sync Pulsar enabled. </p><p>You’ll need a G-Sync Pulsar-compatible display to use this feature. Most displays have a backlight that’s always on, so images fade from one frame to the next. On G-Sync Pulsar displays, there are several horizontal backlight sections. The backlights pulse from top to bottom. This is said to help the pixels in each frame stabilize before they’re backlit, resulting in lower motion blur. </p><p>It’s interesting stuff. Acer, AOC, ASUS and MSI are each releasing a G-Sync Pulsar-compatible 27-inch monitor this week.</p><figure><img src=\"https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2026-01/66a8a0f0-ea3c-11f0-bfee-7797bdd266e8\" data-crop-orig-src=\"https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2026-01/66a8a0f0-ea3c-11f0-bfee-7797bdd266e8\" style=\"height:1080px;width:1530px;\" alt=\"8BitDo FlipPad\" data-uuid=\"725a4eb2-b568-334f-b4b9-0726fec4b7c3\"><figcaption>8BitDo FlipPad</figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">8BitDo</div></figure><p>The <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/gaming/8bitdo-is-unveiling-a-new-mobile-gaming-pad-at-ces-134555603.html\" data-i13n=\"cpos:97;pos:1\">FlipPad</a> is one of my favorite things I’ve seen coming out of CES this year, even though I don’t think I’d actually use it very much.

    "title": "CES 2026 offered a lonely vision of the future",
    "body": "<p><a target=\"_blank\" class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/home/lg-at-ces-2026-live-updates-from-the-companys-world-premiere-event-190159076.html\" data-i13n=\"cpos:1;pos:1\">LG opened CES 2026</a> by outlining its vision to reduce the physical effort and mental burden of life. Buy enough of the devices it’s presently working on and you’ll exist in an environment of “ambient care,” coddled by the machinery in your home. It sounds positively utopian: When the sensors in your bed know you’ve not slept well and are getting a cold, a <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/home/smart-home/lgs-cloid-robot-can-fold-laundry-and-serve-food-very-slowly-181902306.html\" data-i13n=\"cpos:2;pos:1\">robot</a> will wake you with a glass of freshly squeezed orange juice. When you’re in a rush to get to work, the robot will make you a sandwich for you to eat on the go, sparing you the effort of making it yourself. The more I roamed the halls of the show after that, the more I couldn’t help feeling uneasy about what so many companies here were pitching. To me, the vision of the future on show here is equal parts solitary and infantilized.</p><p>There’s obvious reasons for this: <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/ai/everything-nvidia-announced-at-ces-2026-225653684.html\" data-i13n=\"cpos:3;pos:1\">AI swallowed</a> the tech industry’s oxygen, sapping any chance of innovation in consumer hardware. The advent of <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/computing/ces-2026-intel-hopes-its-core-ultra-series-3-chips-are-the-start-of-a-comeback-000155611.html\" data-i13n=\"cpos:4;pos:1\">Panther Lake</a> is a win for Intel, but it’s not going to enable dramatic changes in how people work with their PCs on a daily basis. The US policy shift away <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/transportation/evs/a-shaky-year-for-american-evs-could-set-the-tone-for-2026-153000210.html\" data-i13n=\"cpos:5;pos:1\">from EVs</a> and toward fossil fuel-powered vehicles, too, means that the big names in auto manufacture have similarly shied away from the show. That left CES full of various robotics startups offering early visions of humanoid robots designed to work on <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/boston-dynamics-unveils-production-ready-version-of-atlas-robot-at-ces-2026-234047882.html\" data-i13n=\"cpos:6;pos:1\">production lines</a>, take care of your home and replace your pet. I saw more than a few stands where booth attendants were pretending to delight in <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.instagram.com/reel/DTRC3lOEg8j/?igsh=NTc4MTIwNjQ2YQ%3D%3D\" data-i13n=\"cpos:7;pos:1\">teaching their wheeled robot pets to play fetch</a>. At least, I <em>hope</em> they were pretending.</p><p>I’m painfully aware of how many devices felt like they were only a hop, skip and a jump away from the Sharper Image catalog. Gadgets that are designed to fill some perceived hole in your life that won’t actually make things better or easier in the long run. I’m leery about denigrating assistive technology that offers a vital lifeline to people with accessibility needs. I’m also leery about knocking devices that may enable people to keep working despite wrestling with long term injuries — I&#39;ve got one eye on the raft of exoskeletons exhibited at the show which might help me work in the garden despite the weakness in my lower back. But I’m also not quite sold on how many <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/home/smart-home/throne-from-the-co-founder-of-whoop-uses-computer-vision-to-study-your-poop-150000606.html\" data-i13n=\"cpos:8;pos:1\">toilet computers</a>, massage chairs and <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xu28o7TF8IE\" data-i13n=\"cpos:9;pos:1\">scootcases</a> we all need in our daily lives.&nbsp;</p><p>There’s also the elephant in the room that many of these innovations seem intent on acting as a replacement, substitute or supplement for real interaction. Robotic panda bears scuttling around your home to save you the effort of caring for a real flesh-and-blood pet. <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/gaming/pc/razer-put-a-waifu-in-a-bottle-at-ces-2026-205315908.html\" data-i13n=\"cpos:10;pos:1\">Holographic AI waifus</a> that will obsequiously respond to whatever you ask of it with nothing but flattery and agreement. The sheer volume of <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/ces-2026-live-updates-on-the-latest-gadgets-at-the-biggest-tech-event-of-the-year-153146311.html\" data-i13n=\"cpos:11;pos:1\">AI Labubus</a> operating as friend, enemy, companion or a combination of all the above. Cuddly home robots that are little more than a <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/home/smart-home/i-cant-get-over-this-goofy-long-necked-cyber-pet-robot-at-ces-175900062.html\" data-i13n=\"cpos:12;pos:1\">tablet on a moveable base</a> that’ll keep your kids entertained so you don’t have to. Yes, I’m being unfair, but sometimes shows like this make me sound like someone’s grandpa angrily insisting you darn kids get off your screens.&nbsp;</p><p>I feel some of these gadgets are specifically designed to enable a degree of detachment from our own bodies. We’re spending so much time getting dopamine from our devices that we’re no longer able to pay attention to how our bodies are feeling. In LG’s vision of the future, moving around for ourselves and making our own food is a thing of the past, which will, surely, put a dent in our physical and mental health. We lose the ability to connect with the people around us because we’ve spent too long being flattered by our AI lackeys. We need a machine to monitor the food we eat and the crap we excrete because we’re not willing to pay attention to what we’re doing. Much in the same way that AI encourages us to take shortcuts rather than enjoy the process of being creative, the rest of the tech industry seemingly wants us to shortcut the fundamentals of life.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ces-2026-offered-a-lonely-vision-of-the-future-160000993.html?src=rss",

The company advertises that this charger is a good fit for the iPhone, Apple Watch, AirPods and Samsung devices, among others. The new Nano Charger is on the smaller side, with dual folding prongs that rotate to fit most outlets.</p> \n<p>The deal does require a coupon code, but it's auto-applied at checkout.

Its 16-inch display can physically expand sideways into ultra-wide formats, turning flight sims and racing games into full cockpit experiences at the press of a couple of keys. It’s impractical, faintly ridiculous and absolutely the kind of CES concept we hope survives long enough to escape the demo floor.</p><h2 id=\"jump-link-lenovo-thinkbook-xd-rollable\">Lenovo ThinkBook XD Rollable</h2><figure><img src=\"https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/XD-rollable-back.jpg\" data-crop-orig-src=\"https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/XD-rollable-back.jpg\" style=\"height:2000px;width:3333px;\" alt=\"With its XD Rollable concept, Lenovo took the Thinkbook Plus Gen 6&#39;s basic design and made it even more futuristic by allowing its flexible display to wrap around onto its lid.\" data-uuid=\"5ca5fe56-6894-4cd9-8f38-2fd1b5e0de40\"><figcaption>With its XD Rollable concept, Lenovo took the Thinkbook Plus Gen 6&#39;s basic design and made it even more futuristic by allowing its flexible display to wrap around onto its lid.</figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Sam Rutherford for Engadget</div></figure><p>If the Legion Pro Rollable is excessive, the <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/computing/laptops/lenovo-goes-sci-fi-with-its-wild-xd-rollable-concept-at-ces-2026-010000817.html\" data-i13n=\"cpos:11;pos:1\">ThinkBook XD Rollable</a> is philosophically confusing. Its flexible display doesn’t just grow taller, it wraps over the lid to create a “world-facing” screen for people sitting across from you, which feels either futuristic or deeply unnecessary depending on your mood and situation (maybe this is the perfect device for hotel check-ins and other points of sale?). Still, it’s a gorgeous piece of hardware theater and proof Lenovo is determined to roll screens onto every surface it can reach.</p><h2 id=\"jump-link-ohdoki-handy-2-pro\">OhDoki Handy 2 Pro</h2><figure><img src=\"https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/handy2.jpg\" data-crop-orig-src=\"https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/handy2.jpg\" style=\"height:1012px;width:1800px;\" alt=\"Image of The Handy 2 and Handy 2 Pro\" data-uuid=\"9f025e81-246a-4ff1-810a-6824e6d7216a\"><figcaption>Image of The Handy 2 and Handy 2 Pro</figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Daniel Cooper for Engadget</div></figure><p><a target=\"_blank\" class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/general/the-handy-2-pro-is-an-overclockable-sex-toy-044456140.html\" data-i13n=\"cpos:12;pos:1\">OhDoki’s Handy 2 Pro</a> arrived at CES with one clear message: more power, fewer limits and absolutely no chill. The upgraded sex toy model cranks battery life up to five hours and unlocks a Turbo mode so aggressive it was described as “overclocked,” which is not a term we expected to hear in this category. It can also charge your phone, because apparently even pleasure tech needs to justify itself with productivity.</p><h2 id=\"jump-link-ipolish\">iPolish</h2><figure><img src=\"https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/ipolishbody.jpg\" data-crop-orig-src=\"https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/ipolishbody.jpg\" style=\"height:1013px;width:1800px;\" alt=\"iPolish\" data-uuid=\"f59e675b-3650-499d-bfa3-e0806625ec0a\"><figcaption>iPolish</figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Daniel Cooper for Engadget</div></figure><p><a target=\"_blank\" class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/wearables/ipolish-brings-color-changing-press-on-smart-nails-to-ces-001345407.html\" data-i13n=\"cpos:13;pos:1\">iPolish</a> finally made <em>Total Recall</em> nail tech real, minus the dystopia and Schwarzenegger.

A camera in the crisper records what’s inside, while a built-in barcode scanner in the water dispenser can add items to your shopping list with a quick wave, no app fumbling required.

In Lego form, our little friends look…kinda strange? I&#39;m not the biggest Lego builder, but I am a rather accomplished architect in <em>Minecraft</em>, so I am well aware of the innate challenge in constructing a rounded shape from square blocks. Take Pikachu, for instance. Part of his appeal is his chubby little cheeks. There are bricks with more rounded sides in this collection that hint at his usual rotundness, but the proportions of his face just feel a little off to me. I had the same reaction to the other figures as well, although Eevee seems to have fared a little better than the others. They&#39;re all sort of cute, but not nearly so cute as they are in other formats. But like I said, Lego is not my personal block of choice, so perhaps I&#39;m in the minority here! If you love these bricky pocket monsters, then roll on over to Lego&#39;s website and snap up these kits faster than a Mewtwo.</p> \n<p>\n <core-commerce id=\"07a593e6a4ec4528b3a5be4a04e3e558\" data-type=\"product-list\" data-original-url=\"https://www.lego.com/en-us/product/pikachu-and-poke-ball-72152\"></core-commerce></p> \n<p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/legos-first-pokemon-sets-are-now-available-for-pre-order-205527102.html?src=rss",

    "title": "Dell revives its XPS laptops after a boneheaded rebranding",
    "body": "<p>Last year, <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/computing/dell-dumps-its-pc-brands-to-be-more-like-apple-194524781.html\" data-i13n=\"cpos:1;pos:1\">Dell killed off all of its PC brands</a>, including the iconic XPS lineup, and replaced them with a simplified naming scheme. It was a move meant to make it easier for people to discern between the company&#39;s many brands, but in reality, it just just made the company&#39;s lineup even more confusing. We called it an unforced error at the time, but after seeing how much Dell&#39;s PC market share fell over 2025, it&#39;s fair to say that rebranding was an absolute marketing disaster. </p><p>So, with its tail between its legs, Dell has returned to CES some welcome news for its fans: <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/computing/laptops/it-took-guts-for-dell-to-admit-its-mistake-heres-how-xps-will-make-its-big-comeback-233248173.html\" data-i13n=\"cpos:2;pos:1\">XPS lives</a>! And the company plans to double-down on the brand in ways it never did before. Today, Dell revealed the new XPS 14 and 16 notebooks, which feature a more practical design than the previous models. There&#39;s a new function row with traditional keys, instead of the odd capacitive buttons that disappeared in sunlight. And while the company is sticking with its &quot;invisible&quot; trackpad, which sits flush alongside the wrist rest, there&#39;s now a light border around the edges that lets you feel exactly where the trackpad begins and ends.</p><div><div style=\"left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;\"><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/eJXQ5B7W2sY?rel=0\" style=\"top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;\" allowfullscreen scrolling=\"no\" data-provider-name=\"youtube\"></iframe></div></div><p>So, in short, Dell seems to have solved most of our recent complaints about the XPS lineup. To signify its commitment to the brand, it&#39;s also emblazoning the XPS logo on all of these new machines, replacing the previous Dell name. That’s something I could never imagine a less humbled Dell doing. </p><p>The redesign also gave Dell room to shave off some weight and thickness from both machines. The XPS 14 weighs around three pounds now, a half-pound lighter than the previous generation, while the XPS 16 weighs 3.6 pounds, a whole pound lighter than before. The new cases make both machines look a lot more like Microsoft’s extra-subtle Surface Laptop, but that’s not necessarily a bad thing. Both systems are powered by Intel’s new Panther Lake Core Ultra Series 3 chips, and they also offer tandem OLED display options.</p><p>Dell also briefly teased the return of a new XPS 13 later this year, which is set to be the company’s thinnest and lightest notebook ever.  Dell says it’ll be cheaper than the XPS has been in the past.</p><p>The new XPS 14 and 16 will be available on January 6, starting at $2,050 and $2,200, respectively. A Dell representative tells us these aren’t entry-level configurations, instead we can expect to see cheaper prices with lower specs in February.</p><p><strong>Update 1/6/26, 12:30p: </strong>Pricing updated to reflecrt new numbers from Dell.

    "title": "CES 2026 proved the PC industry is hosed this year",
    "body": "<p>Dell&#39;s <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/computing/laptops/dell-revives-its-xps-laptops-after-a-boneheaded-rebranding-001028029.html\" data-i13n=\"cpos:1;pos:1\">XPS 14 currently costs over $2,000</a>. An AMD executive predicts that PC builders will likely make piecemeal upgrades this year, instead of building entirely new systems. And new AI supercomputers from NVIDIA and AMD are gobbling up the RAM market. At CES 2026, it was hard not to notice the dire year ahead for the computing industry, one that will likely lead to higher prices and more limited availability for consumer goods across the board.</p><p>Really, though, the show just confirmed what was apparent since <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/social-media/engadget-podcast-wtf-is-up-with-ram-with-will-smith-from-the-tech-pod-141442002.html\" data-i13n=\"cpos:2;pos:1\">RAM prices skyrocketed over the last few months</a>, driven by demand from AI datacenters. As Samsung&#39;s marketing leader, Wonjin Lee, <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-01-07/samsung-warns-of-price-hikes-as-rising-memory-costs-affect-all\" data-i13n=\"cpos:3;pos:1\">told Bloomberg</a> at CES: &quot;There&#39;s going to be issues around semiconductor supplies, and it&#39;s going to affect everyone. Prices are going up even as we speak.&quot;</p><p>At first, it appeared that Dell&#39;s new XPS 14 and XPS 16 were among the earliest systems hit by these demands. Last year&#39;s models started at $1,699 and $1,899, respectively, and we were initially told the new models would actually come in cheaper at $1,650 and $1,850. At the moment, the XPS 14 starts at $2,050, while the XPS 16 is $2,200. A Dell representative tells us these aren’t entry-level configurations, instead we can expect to see cheaper systems below $2,000 in February. While those prices haven’t been finalized, the reps say it should be similar to the earlier figures we were given.</p><p>It’s also worth noting that it didn&#39;t take much to configure the earlier models upwards of $2,000. It’s just unfortunate that Dell doesn’t have cheaper configurations available for the launch if its new systems, especially since they look so compelling. Meanwhile, Apple still hasn&#39;t budged its $1,599  MacBook Pro 14-inch pricing. At least Dell still comes in cheaper than the $2,499 MacBook Pro 16-inch.</p><p>On the desktop front, AMD&#39;s David McAfee, Corporate Vice President and GM of Client Channel Business, noted that the longevity of the company&#39;s AM4 and AM5 platforms might be a boon for gamers, since they can upgrade their CPUs without buying new RAM kits and motherboards. That allows for a pathway to better performance without paying out the nose for over-priced RAM.</p><p>&quot;I think that will be potentially a trend that we see in 2026 with more component upgrades, as opposed to full system swap outs and, and altogether rebuilds,&quot; he said in a group interview with Engadget and other outlets. &quot;Some of the most popular CPUs that are still running in gamers’ platforms are parts like the 2600 back to the Pinnacle Ridge days, or 3000 series... Stepping even from there into a little bit more modern 5,000 series processors in an AM4 socket and motherboard, there&#39;s a pretty big boost there.&quot;</p><p>McAfee added that around 30 to 40 percent of AMD&#39;s business still revolves around the AM4 platform, even without the specter of a wild memory market.</p><p>&quot;There&#39;s no product that has memory in it that&#39;s immune to some of these forces around DRAM pricing and, and what it&#39;s doing to the market,&quot; he said, when asked about potential GPU price increases. &quot;I think the, the truth is the volatility that we&#39;ve seen over the past two months or so has really been unprecedented.&quot; </p><p>Looking ahead, he said he expects prices to settle within the first three to six months of the year, but he didn&#39;t discuss his reasoning further. As an aside, he also noted that AMD&#39;s X3D chips, which feature 3D V-cache, actually don&#39;t see much of a hit from slower RAM. Their high amounts of onboard L2 and L3 cache make up for less ideal memory transfer speeds, McAfee said.</p><p>That McAfee commented at all about the state of RAM is noteworthy. Every PC maker I’ve asked, including Dell and Acer, refused to comment on the volatile state of the memory industry ahead of CES. Perhaps they were hoping things would calm down before they had to price their new systems. Ultimately, they’re beholden to an increasingly limited supply of RAM. </p><p>And where is all that memory going? At CES, NVIDIA announced its new <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"link\" href=\"https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/inside-the-nvidia-rubin-platform-six-new-chips-one-ai-supercomputer/#:~:text=Table_title:%20From%20NVIDIA%20Grace%20to%20Vera%E2%80%94scaling%20the,CPU:%20900GB/s%20%7C%20Vera%20CPU:%201.8TB/s%20%7C\" data-i13n=\"cpos:4;pos:1\">Vera Rubin AI supercomputer</a>, which supports up to 54TB of RAM across 36 Vera CPUs and 20.7TB of memory across 72 GPUs. AMD, as well, announced its <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.amd.com/en/blogs/2026/from-ces-2026-to-yottaflops-why-the-amd-keynote.html\" data-i13n=\"cpos:5;pos:1\">new Helios AI rack</a>, which supports up to  31TB of memory across 72 AMD Instinct MI455X GPUs. Given the endless appetite for computing to power AI model building and inferencing, there’s likely going to be a significant demand for these beastly systems.</p><p>Put simply: Our global supply of memory is being sacrificed to appease the AI industry. That’s good news for the likes of OpenAI, Microsoft and NVIDIA, but bad news for anyone who cares about PCs and the consumer products we use every day. Get ready for a year of price hikes.  </p><p><strong>Update 1/12, 3:00p: </strong>Added a mention of lower entry-level configurations coming eventually.</p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/computing/ces-2026-proved-the-pc-industry-is-hosed-this-year-174500314.html?src=rss",

Starting today, Anthropic is giving regular people a way to take advantage of those capabilities, with the release of a new preview feature called <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"link\" href=\"https://urldefense.com/v3/__http://claude.com/blog/__;!!Op6eflyXZCqGR5I!H4Kg5gp_7yMadnW8YNEBXhHxFfRXLlqiUWXMTjA_hFLzMfx0bTA_OeGZT1TyI4CviOt0JcJuN-CbfRfApB7i3w$\" data-i13n=\"cpos:2;pos:1\">Claude Cowork</a>.</p><p>The company is billing Cowork as &quot;a simpler way for anyone — not just developers — to work with Claude.&quot; After you give the system access to a folder on your computer, it can read, edit or create new files in that folder on your behalf. </p><p>Anthropic gives a few different example use cases for Cowork. For instance, you could ask Claude to organize your downloads folder, telling it to rename the files contained within to something that&#39;s easier to parse at a glance. Another example:  you could use Claude to turn screenshots of receipts and invoices into a spreadsheet for tracking expenses. Cowork can also navigate websites — provided you install <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/ai/claudes-chrome-plugin-is-now-available-to-all-paid-users-221024295.html\" data-i13n=\"slk:Claude in Chrome;cpos:3;pos:1\">Claude’s Chrome plugin</a> — and make can use Anthropic&#39;s <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"link\" href=\"https://claude.com/connectors\" data-i13n=\"cpos:4;pos:1\">Connectors framework</a> to access third-party apps like Canva. </p><div><div style=\"left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;\"><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/WBNZpAWhw5E?rel=0\" style=\"top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;\" allowfullscreen scrolling=\"no\" data-provider-name=\"youtube\"></iframe></div></div><p>&quot;Cowork is designed to make using Claude for new work as simple as possible. You don’t need to keep manually providing context or converting Claude’s outputs into the right format,&quot; the company said. &quot;Nor do you have to wait for Claude to finish before offering further ideas or feedback: you can queue up tasks and let Claude work through them in parallel.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p> If the idea of granting Claude access to your computer sounds ill-advised, Anthropic says Claude &quot;can’t read or edit anything you don’t give it explicit access to.&quot; However, the company <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"link\" href=\"https://urldefense.com/v3/__http://claude.com/resources/tutorials/claude-cowork-a-research-preview__;!!Op6eflyXZCqGR5I!H4Kg5gp_7yMadnW8YNEBXhHxFfRXLlqiUWXMTjA_hFLzMfx0bTA_OeGZT1TyI4CviOt0JcJuN-CbfRe6TM4kUQ$\" data-i13n=\"cpos:5;pos:1\">does note</a> the system can &quot;take potentially destructive actions,&quot; such as deleting a file that is important to you or misinterpreting your instructions. For that reason, Anthropic suggests it&#39;s best to give &quot;very clear&quot; guidance to Claude.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Anthropic isn’t the first to offer a computer agent. Microsoft, for example, has been pushing Copilot hard for nearly three years, despite <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/ai/it-seems-like-most-windows-users-dont-care-for-copilot-195500516.html\" data-i13n=\"cpos:6;pos:1\">seemingly limited adoption</a>. For Anthropic, the challenge will be convincing people these tools are useful where others have failed. The fact Claude Code has been universally loved by programmers may make that task easier.   </p><p>For now, Anthropic is giving users of its pricey <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/ai/anthropics-max-plan-offers-nearly-unlimited-claude-usage-for-200-per-month-170032710.html\" data-i13n=\"cpos:7;pos:1\">Claude Max</a> subscription first access to the preview.

It’s the place to stream nearly every Star Wars film and series, plus the full Marvel Cinematic Universe lineup and Disney’s most recent theatrical releases.</p> \n<p>Hulu balances things out with a more adult-oriented lineup of current TV shows, next-day network episodes and a growing roster of award-winning originals. The platform hosts series like <em>The Bear,</em> <em>The Handmaid’s Tale</em> and <em>Only Murders in the Building</em>, alongside comedies, thrillers and documentaries that regularly feature in awards conversations. It’s also the home for next-day streaming of ABC and FX shows, making it especially useful if you’ve already cut the cable cord but still want to keep up with primetime TV.</p> \n<p>The Duo Basic bundle ties these two services together under a single subscription, offering a simple way to expand your library without juggling multiple accounts.

The app can also monitor the spending of you and your partner all in one place, to make it easier to plan together.</p> \n<p>The main drawbacks Engadget found in testing Monarch Money were the app&#39;s learning curve, and the differences in features (and bugginess) between Monarch&#39;s web and mobile versions.

Users also get streaming access to thousands of curated titles. Think of it like Netflix for audiobooks. The catalog is limited, but it gets the job done in a pinch. Subscribers do get access to all Audible original content and they will receive discounts on purchasing audiobooks outright.</p> \n<p>In other words, it&#39;s a neat little service and well worth a buck.

A similar situation happened that same year in July on a domestic <a data-i13n=\"cpos:9;pos:1\" href=\"https://www.the-independent.com/travel/delta-lithium-battery-explosion-b2785087.html\">Delta flight, </a>and again in August on a transatlantic <a data-i13n=\"cpos:10;pos:1\" href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/video-smoke-plane-cabin-midflight-portable-phone-charger-fire/\">KLM flight</a>. As a result, some airlines, including <a data-i13n=\"cpos:11;pos:1\" href=\"https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/major-airline-announces-ban-series-182956108.html\">Emirates</a>, <a data-i13n=\"cpos:12;pos:1\" href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/05/21/nx-s1-5406294/southwest-airlines-will-require-passengers-to-keep-chargers-visible-due-to-fire-risk\">Southwest</a> and others have announced further restrictions on flying with battery packs.</p> \n<p>Rules include limiting the number of allowed portable chargers and requiring flyers to keep power banks in clear view when using them to recharge a device. If the battery pack isn’t actively in use, however, most rules allow them to stay in your carry-on bag in the overhead bin. Before flying, it’s wise to check your airline’s policies.</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-capacity\"><strong>Capacity</strong></h3> \n<p>If you just need to keep a smartphone from dying before you can make it home, just about <a data-i13n=\"cpos:13;pos:1\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/computing/accessories/best-power-bank-143048526.html\">any of the best power banks will do</a>. But if you need to revive multiple devices or the substantial battery of a laptop, you’ll want something with a high milliamp-hour​​ (mAh) capacity. A power bank capable of delivering enough power to a laptop will have a capacity between 20,000 and 27,000 mAh.</p> \n<p>If you want something even bigger than a laptop power bank, and don’t need to fly with it, you’ll likely want to look into portable power stations. These can be the size of a car battery or larger and can potentially fuel an entire weekend away.</p> \n<p>Another thing to keep in mind is that the capacity listed in a power bank&#39;s specs is not what will be delivered to your devices. As I mentioned, the capacity of these banks is around 25,000mAh. Even the huge battery on a 16-inch MacBook Pro or a Dell XPS 16 has a mAh rating of around 5,000 - 6,000mAh, so you might think you’d get five full charges but in reality, you only get about a single 70-percent charge. The voltage is different (typically 3.7V for the power bank and 11.4V for a laptop) which makes the watt-hours, or the amount of energy each battery can hold, different (working out to 92Wh for the battery and 72Wh for the built-in laptop batteries). On top of that, in order to feed a charge from a power bank to a laptop, a voltage conversion takes place and that dissipates a decent amount of energy.</p> \n<p>Without turning this into a physics lesson, this all means that a power bank with a 25,000mAh (or 92Wh) capacity will typically fill a 5,000mAh (or 72Wh) laptop battery to about 75 percent. In my tests, I averaged about a 60-percent efficiency rate between a power bank’s listed capacity and the actual charge delivered.</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-ports\"><strong>Ports</strong></h3> \n<p>Every large power bank I’ve tested has at least three USB ports, with a mix of USB-C and USB-A, which should cover nearly any portable device you need to recharge — earbuds, phones, tablets, laptops, you name it. In addition to the different plug formats, some ports supply power at different wattages. For example, one built-in USB-C port might be rated for 60 watts, while the one next to it is rated for 100 watts. So if you’ve got a device that’s capable of 70W fast charging, such as the new MacBook Air, you’d want to opt for the 100W port to get the best charging speeds possible.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Note that devices with a smaller wattage draw won’t be negatively affected by connecting to ports with high ratings. For example, a Galaxy S24 Ultra, capable of 45W super fast charging, is perfectly compatible with the 100W port. A device will only draw what it can take, regardless of what a port can supply. Just remember that the port, device <em>and</em> charging cable need to be at or above the desired wattage rating to achieve maximum charging rates.</p> \n<p>Some of these larger batteries also have AC ports. It might seem like a natural fit to plug in your laptop’s power adapter for a recharge. But really, the AC port should only be for devices that can’t use USB — such as a lamp or a printer. Plugging a power adapter into the AC port only wastes energy through conversion. First, the battery converts its DC power to supply the port with AC power, then the power adapter converts that AC power back to DC so your laptop can take it in. And as you’ll remember from physics class, each time energy is converted, some is lost to heat and other dissipations. Better to cut out the middleman and just send that DC power straight from the battery to the device.</p> \n<p>Also, you can use more than one port at a time with these devices; just remember that the speed of whatever you’re charging will likely go down, and of course, the battery is going to drain proportionally to what you’re refilling.</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-wireless-charging\"><strong>Wireless charging</strong></h3> \n<p>Since I first started testing portable power banks a few years ago, wireless charging capabilities have noticeably improved. The first few I tried were painfully slow and not worth recommending. Now the wireless pads built into power banks are impressively fast — particularly, in my experience, when charging Samsung Galaxy phones (though the lack of a stabilizing magnetic connection like Apple’s MagSafe means they only work when rested flat on a pad). Most wireless charging connections can be used while other ports are also being employed, making them convenient for some mobile battlestation setups.</p> \n<p>Of course, wireless charging is always less efficient than wired, and recharging from an external battery is less efficient in general. If you want to waste as little energy as possible, you’re better off sticking to wired connections.</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-design\"><strong>Design</strong></h3> \n<p>All power banks are designed to be portable, but there’s a big difference between a pocket-friendly 5,000mAh battery and one of these laptop-compatible bruisers. Most of the latter weigh between a pound and a half to two pounds, which is a considerable addition to a backpack. Many of the options listed here have a display to tell you how much charge remains in the battery, which is helpful when you’re trying to judiciously meet out charges to your devices. If a bank has a wireless connection, the pad is usually on the flat top and any available AC connection is usually at one end. Both may require you to engage those charging methods. Don’t be like me and grumble loudly that you got a bum unit without pressing (and sometimes double pressing) all the buttons first.</p> \n<h2 id=\"jump-link-how-we-test-portable-laptop-chargers\">How we test portable laptop chargers</h2> \n<p>For the past three years, I’ve been testing and using dozens of portable batteries for our <a data-i13n=\"cpos:14;pos:1\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/best-power-bank-143048526.html\">other battery guide</a>. Some of those batteries include the higher-capacity power banks you see here. I also got a hold of a few extra banks just for this guide to make sure we covered what’s available. I went for brands I’m already familiar with, as well as battery packs from well-received manufacturers I hadn’t tried before (like UGREEN and Lion Energy). I only considered banks with at least a 20,000mAh capacity and mostly stuck with those that rated 25,000mAh and higher.</p> \n<p>Here’s everything we tested:</p> \n<ul> \n <li><p><a

\n<p>I tested each power bank with an Apple phone (iPhone 15 or 16), an Android phone (Galaxy S23 Ultra), a tablet (M1 iPad Air) and a laptop (16-inch MacBook Pro with the M1 Pro chip). Even though these banks can charge multiple devices at once, I refilled one at a time, to make side-by-side comparisons more straightforward. I drained the batteries of the phones and tablets to between zero and five percent and then didn’t use any device as it refilled.</p> \n<p>For the MacBook, I let it run down to 10 percent before plugging in the power bank. That&#39;s when most laptops give display a “connect to power” warning, as draining any battery to empty will compromise the battery life. I then used it as one might in a mobile office, with a Bluetooth keyboard and mouse, while connected to Wi-Fi and a VPN.</p> \n<p>For each test, I noted how long a completely charged battery took to get a device back to full and how much of the battery’s capacity was used up in one charge. I also noted things like portability, apparent durability, helpful features and overall design.</p> \n<p>For reference, here are the battery capacities of the devices I used:</p> \n<ul> \n <li><p>iPhone 15: 3,349mAh</p></li> \n <li><p>Galaxy S23 Ultra: 4,855mAh</p></li> \n <li><p>iPad Air (5th gen): 7,729mAh</p></li> \n <li><p>16-inch M1 Pro MacBook Pro: 27,027mAh</p></li> \n</ul> \n<h2 id=\"jump-link-other-laptop-power-banks-we-tested\">Other laptop power banks we tested</h2> \n<p><strong>HyperJuice 245W</strong></p> \n<p>Hyper’s <a data-i13n=\"elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Hyper;elmt:;cpos:27;pos:1\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=2c93a509-c37a-4798-b978-795281692d23&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=c803d2c4-bcfe-4f4a-8b7d-1f390c4e3c3d&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Hyper&amp;linkText=HyperJuice+245W&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5oeXBlcnNob3AuY29tL3Byb2R1Y3RzL2h5cGVyanVpY2UtMjQ1dy11c2ItYy1iYXR0ZXJ5LXBhY2siLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6ImM4MDNkMmM0LWJjZmUtNGY0YS04YjdkLTFmMzkwYzRlM2MzZCIsIm9yaWdpbmFsVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuaHlwZXJzaG9wLmNvbS9wcm9kdWN0cy9oeXBlcmp1aWNlLTI0NXctdXNiLWMtYmF0dGVyeS1wYWNrIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAaz3PR-XqcBdnqO82nXy1rrlde5SZd2vCx9OZRQD-8m2&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hypershop.com%2Fproducts%2Fhyperjuice-245w-usb-c-battery-pack\" class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" data-original-link=\"https://www.hypershop.com/products/hyperjuice-245w-usb-c-battery-pack\">HyperJuice 245W</a> brick looks great and has a hefty 27,000mAh capacity.

Phone power banks tend to have a capacity ranging from 5,000mAh to 20,000mAh and laptop powerbanks are typically rated between 20,000mAh and 27,000mAh. There’s no official definition, however. Laptop batteries are simply larger and need a bigger supply of power to give them a meaningful charge.</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-how-do-you-fast-charge-a-power-bank\"><strong>How do you fast charge a power bank?</strong></h3> \n<p>You can charge a power bank exactly as fast as the power bank’s internal mechanisms will allow. Most batteries are limited in how quickly they can accept and deliver a charge to avoid dangerously overheating. But to make sure you’re charging a bank as quickly as possible, make sure the wall adapter and the USB-C cable you are using have a high wattage rating — using a 5W power brick and a 10W cable will take a lot longer to refill your bank than a 65W wall charger and a 100W cord.</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-what-size-power-bank-do-i-need-for-a-laptop\"><strong>What size power bank do I need for a laptop?</strong></h3> \n<p>Look for a power bank with a rating of at least 20,000mAh. Slightly smaller batteries may work, but they won’t deliver a significant charge laptops.</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-how-many-mah-to-charge-a-laptop\"><strong>How many mAh to charge a laptop?</strong></h3> \n<p>A milliamp hour (mAh) is how much a battery can hold, and most portable batteries list their capacity using mAh. If you get a battery rated at 20,000mAh or above, it should be able to charge your laptop.</p> \n<p>Using mAh to discuss laptop batteries can be confusing. Due to differing voltages, you can’t directly compare the mAh ratings of a power bank battery to a laptop battery. Using watt-hours is a better gauge, as <a data-i13n=\"elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Goal Zero;elmt:;cpos:28;pos:1\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=30d072b7-7973-41b4-a737-1ec377f5fbf6&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=c803d2c4-bcfe-4f4a-8b7d-1f390c4e3c3d&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Goal+Zero&amp;linkText=that+calculation&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL2dvYWx6ZXJvLmNvbS9wYWdlcy93YXR0YWdlLWNhbGN1bGF0b3IiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6ImM4MDNkMmM0LWJjZmUtNGY0YS04YjdkLTFmMzkwYzRlM2MzZCIsIm9yaWdpbmFsVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly9nb2FsemVyby5jb20vcGFnZXMvd2F0dGFnZS1jYWxjdWxhdG9yIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAZAoNSNAK2PEx3aooXTpsHfiMd2Y4p7JIDJ0pgc2xQFm&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fgoalzero.com%2Fpages%2Fwattage-calculator\" class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" data-original-link=\"https://goalzero.com/pages/wattage-calculator\">that calculation</a> takes voltage into account.</p> \n<h2 id=\"jump-link-recent-updates\">Recent updates</h2> \n<p><strong>November 2025</strong>: Updated our overall top pick to the Anker Laptop Power bank.

    "title": "The CES companies hoping your brain is the next big thing in computing",
    "body": "<p>At every CES I’ve ever been to, there’s been one or two gadgets promising to boost your mental health. In recent years, the number of companies making forays into this space has grown, and will likely continue to do so in the future. Could it be, much like the number of people wearing heart-monitoring wearables today, everyone will be strapping an EEG to their skulls a decade or so down the line? It’s more likely than you think, so it’s worth asking what these devices are good for, what benefit they could bring, and where does the science end and the hype begin.</p><p>An Electroencephalogram (EEG) is a clinical tool to monitor the electrical activity of our brains. Put very simply, our minds are constantly moving ions around, and when they reach the scalp, it’s possible to measure those ions. By placing electrodes on the scalp, you can record the changes in voltages pushed out by our brains more or less in real time. These voltages are commonly grouped into categories, which are often described as <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"link\" href=\"https://nin.nl/about-the-brain/brain-waves/\" data-i13n=\"cpos:1;pos:1\">brain waves</a>. Each one <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/agricultural-and-biological-sciences/brain-waves\" data-i13n=\"cpos:2;pos:1\">represents</a> a different state of mind: Gamma (hard thinking), Beta (anxious or active), Alpha (relaxed), Theta (creative, or dreaming) and Delta (asleep).&nbsp;</p><p><a target=\"_blank\" class=\"link\" href=\"https://profiles.ucl.ac.uk/2747-karl-friston\" data-i13n=\"cpos:3;pos:1\">Professor Karl Friston</a> at University College London is one of the world’s most influential neuroscientists and an expert in brain imaging. He explained that these technologies can be used to diagnose issues both in the structure and function of the brain. And while there are many technologies which can look at how our brains work, “we’re a long way away from understanding the brain like we understand the heart.” Broadly speaking, EEGs are a fairly simple tool for looking at how our minds work, but they have one benefit over more complex methods such as fMRI (functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging), since they work in real time.</p><p>Consumer-use EEGs are nothing new — in 2011 I tested the <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2011-09-28-zeo-mobile-turns-phones-into-a-sleep-clinic-aids-in-advanced-po.html\" data-i13n=\"cpos:4;pos:1\">Zeo Mobile</a>, a small device which you stuck to your forehead and wore overnight. It monitored how well you slept and sounded an alarm when you were at the top of a sleep cycle, so you woke up pretty easily. It worked well but with one downside: It’s hard to sleep with a hard plastic puck stuck to your forehead.</p><p>EEGs are more recently used as part of brain computer interfaces, or for neurofeedback tools to help you calibrate the quality of your meditation. InteraXon, for instance, makes the <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/wearables/muses-new-wearable-eeg-knows-how-hard-youre-thinking-120041154.html\" data-i13n=\"cpos:5;pos:1\">Muse</a> headbands which will monitor your brain waves, telling you when you shift states. Last year, EEG startup Neurable partnered with Master &amp; Dynamic to launch the <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/neurables-brainwave-tracking-master--dynamic-headphones-tell-you-when-to-take-a-break-120004736.html\" data-i13n=\"cpos:6;pos:1\">MW75S Neuro</a>, a pair of high-end headphones designed to track your focus levels. When your attention starts to wane, the system will alert you, advising you to take a rest with the hope of alleviating burnout.</p><figure><img src=\"https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/eeg-neurablemeditation.jpg\" data-crop-orig-src=\"https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/eeg-neurablemeditation.jpg\" style=\"height:1200px;width:1800px;\" alt=\"Neurable\" data-uuid=\"30ad23d1-6c56-4a60-aec7-95ae6e6ac554\"/><figcaption>Neurable</figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Daniel Cooper for Engadget</div></figure><p>At CES this year, Neurable announced a partnership with HP’s gaming arm HyperX to produce EEG headsets with specific benefits for gamers. As gamers are looking for any way to improve their performance, the company has developed algorithms and training programs to help. You might already know that being in a place of high stress isn’t great for your concentration and focus. Consequently, Neurable research scientist Dr. Alicia Howell-Munson walked me through a system that encourages you to reach a state of calm focus with demonstrable improvements in reaction time and accuracy. It’s a system that was initially designed in partnership with Singapore’s Air Force to help ensure pilots remain in a state of calm focus.&nbsp;</p><p>I sat through this demo myself, initially testing my skills in Aimlabs (a tool people use to test their reflexes) where my accuracy and reaction times were measured. Then, while wearing Neurable’s headset, I had to practice focusing my attention on a galaxy of dots, the greater my focus, the slower and closer together the dots got. That wasn’t an easy process, and it took me nearly five minutes to reach the point where I could push all of the dots to coalesce into a single point on the screen. But, when I had, I retook the shooting gallery, and saw dramatic spikes in my performance. My accuracy increased from 91.3 to 99.1 percent, while my reaction time fell from 623ms to 532ms.&nbsp;</p><figure><img src=\"https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/eeg-nurablehyperx.jpg\" data-crop-orig-src=\"https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/eeg-nurablehyperx.jpg\" style=\"height:1200px;width:1800px;\" alt=\"Neurable HyperX headset\" data-uuid=\"faf3e60d-a791-4a8b-8e58-e2c86e36f5dc\"/><figcaption>Neurable HyperX headset</figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Daniel Cooper for Engadget</div></figure><p>Neurable believes that its systems, which are designed to integrate with any manufacturer’s gear, has the potential to dramatically increase a person’s brain health and productivity. For instance, by taking a break when a person’s focus started to wane, they were able to bounce back and function for far longer than if they’d simply pushed harder. Similarly, the company can advise on your cognitive speed and brain age and guide you toward making healthy choices. The company says that this isn’t just about wellness, either, as being able to identify loss of focus is vital, for instance, to help reduce auto accidents when truck drivers feel fatigued.&nbsp;</p><p>Co-founder Adam Molnar explained that the benefits of this technology compound over time, so the more practice a user has in finding that mental state of calm focus, the easier it will be to maintain it for longer. CEO Ramses Alcaide added the company’s aim is to enable people to visualize the often invisible symptoms of cognitive stress to ensure they’re looking after themselves. He added that one thing that separates Neurable from other companies is that it’s looking at far finer-grain detail from its EEG data.&nbsp;</p><figure><img src=\"https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/eeg-mywaves.jpg\" data-crop-orig-src=\"https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/eeg-mywaves.jpg\" style=\"height:1013px;width:1800px;\" alt=\"MyWaves\" data-uuid=\"6a5c70c7-2b45-4ad2-ab44-94cadc3beb6f\"/><figcaption>MyWaves</figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Daniel Cooper for Engadget</div></figure><p>There are plenty of companies at CES that are using EEGs for more specific goals, such as <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"link\" href=\"https://mywaves.tech/\" data-i13n=\"cpos:7;pos:1\">MyWaves</a>. It uses an EEG as part of its broader offering to use sound patterns to make it easier to go to sleep. It sells you a pricey forehead-worn EEG which you wear for a few nights over the course of a year. From there, the system produces a half hour audio file that will mirror the pattern of your delta brainwaves. It claims that, if you listen to the track before you go to bed, the experience of hearing your delta waves will help you fall asleep faster and experience more REM sleep.</p><p>And there are plenty of companies which are building EEGs for you to wear to keep an eye on your mental health. Brain-Life, for instance, showed off an early prototype of Focus+, a headband EEG with a companion app that can offer feedback on your cognitive load. It can also tell you how long you can sustain your attention and how well your mind relaxes and recovers. The company didn’t have details on when the hardware would be available or how much it cost, as it’s still early days.</p><figure><img src=\"https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/eeg-braineulink.jpg\" data-crop-orig-src=\"https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/eeg-braineulink.jpg\" style=\"height:1013px;width:1800px;\" alt=\"BrainEULink.\" data-uuid=\"e4c2dc73-4c20-444b-a63b-57fe79c0cfac\"/><figcaption>BrainEULink.</figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Daniel Cooper for Engadget</div></figure><p>There is broad potential to use an EEG as a brain computer interface, such as the one worked on by Braineulink. That company has combined an EEG with an AR headset to enable people to interact with the world just with their brains. For instance, in a demonstration in the show floor at CES, I was able to turn a light on and off by “focusing” on it, although it’s hard to know how useful that would be in, for instance, creating an assistive device for folks with limited mobility. Like Brain-Life, it’s early days, and so there’s no product that we can point to, but it’s clear we’re going to see more startups looking to enter this world.&nbsp;</p><figure><img src=\"https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/eeg-brainlife.jpg\" data-crop-orig-src=\"https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/eeg-brainlife.jpg\" style=\"height:1013px;width:1800px;\" alt=\"Brain-Life\" data-uuid=\"8e00a0f7-f339-4ff2-b4f3-d7715ddd928b\"/><figcaption>Brain-Life</figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Daniel Cooper for Engadget</div></figure><p>As EEGs become more commonplace, it’s likely they’ll be packaged in smaller devices which fit more seamlessly into our lives. One such example is NAOX, a French startup which has built a wearable, clinical-grade EEG into a pair of earbuds for the sort of longitudinal testing required to diagnose conditions like epilepsy. But the company is also planning on incorporating the technology into a pair of true wireless earbuds.These headphones won’t be arriving until the end of 2026, but Naox says the tech is small enough that it can be integrated with other companies earbuds. Consequently, it’s certainly plausible we could see plenty of earbuds that will keep an eye on our brain health as a side hustle.&nbsp;</p><figure><img src=\"https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/eeg-naoxclinical.jpg\" data-crop-orig-src=\"https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/eeg-naoxclinical.jpg\" style=\"height:1013px;width:1800px;\" alt=\"Naox\" data-uuid=\"09b9102c-62ab-4c72-8f85-cd0bfd2d0408\"/><figcaption>Naox</figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Daniel Cooper for Engadget</div></figure><p>NAOX was co-founded by Dr. Michel Le Van Quyen who, <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKhpC2qijQA\" data-i13n=\"cpos:8;pos:1\">at a talk in London in December 2025</a>, talked about the rationale for creating an in-ear ECG.

I was curious about the science behind an ear-mounted EEG given they commonly use the scalp. Professor Friston said that an ear-mounted EEG is potentially more useful as “you can get slightly closer to the sources of activity.” And that it makes a lot of sense for a consumer-grade EEG to be added to wireless earbuds given their utility in practices like meditation.</p><figure><img src=\"https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/eeg-naoxtws.jpg\" data-crop-orig-src=\"https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/eeg-naoxtws.jpg\" style=\"height:1013px;width:1800px;\" alt=\"Naox&#39;s prototype TWS earbuds sensors.\" data-uuid=\"57ea4c48-a263-4b21-a655-64e6ccbeafcd\"/><figcaption>Naox&#39;s prototype TWS earbuds sensors.</figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Daniel Cooper for Engadget</div></figure><p>One downside of the proliferation of wearable EEGs is that it could lead users to jump to the wrong conclusions about their mental health. For instance, if someone is to be diagnosed with a condition such as epilepsy, they need to undergo a 24-hour perambulatory EEG. As Professor Friston explained, the recording of that 24 hour EEG would be “carefully scrutinized by experts who are able to run a differential diagnosis ... to specify what further investigations are required.” He, like a lot of clinicians, is concerned about ill-informed consumers using these devices to make medical interventions without consulting a professional.&nbsp;</p><p>Friston added that people shouldn’t expect wearable EEGs to be magic bullets for their brain health or cognition. He said the best way for a consumer to approach them is by treating them with the same level of reverence as a household thermometer. “Are thermometers useful in managing the wellness of my children?, Yes,” he explained, “can your thermometer tell you what particular virus you have? Absolutely not.” “In the context of well-being and to augment or validate practices such as mindfulness and meditation, they can be fun and useful quantitative devices.” But, fundamentally, that is all he feels they can be, especially right now.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/wearables/the-ces-companies-hoping-your-brain-is-the-next-big-thing-in-computing-175048601.html?src=rss",

But if you&#39;re clueless, read on.</p><p>Whenever any device connects to the internet — whether it&#39;s a laptop, a phone or a <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/lego-unveils-a-technology-packed-smart-brick-at-ces-2026-190000511.html\" data-i13n=\"cpos:2;pos:1\">smart Lego brick</a> — it&#39;s assigned a unique IP address that other devices can use to identify it. Think of the name you give the barista at a coffee shop, except instead of a hot beverage, you’re being served websites and digital audio and video.</p><p>That&#39;s the upside. The downside is that a device&#39;s IP address can be used to find its location in the real world. That means service providers can show you local weather reports — as well as targeted local ads. More ominously, however, it means service providers can restrict what you see online based on where you are physically. That impacts everything from the fun (what Netflix has available to stream) to the serious (what information gets censored on the government&#39;s behalf).</p><p><a target=\"_blank\" class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/what-is-a-vpn-and-what-can-you-do-with-one-161549146.html\" data-i13n=\"cpos:3;pos:1\">A VPN gets around that downside</a> by running all your online activity through a middleman server before sending it to its destination. Instead of your real IP address, everyone sees the address of the VPN server, along with its geolocation. That means you can subvert any local restrictions getting in your way: You’re actually in Houston, but so far as the website you’re viewing is concerned, you seem to be coming from Amsterdam. Here&#39;s how to do it.</p><h2 id=\"jump-link-how-to-change-your-virtual-location-with-a-vpn\"><strong>How to change your virtual location with a VPN</strong></h2><p>With so many excellent commercial VPNs on the market, changing your virtual location is a lot easier than it sounds.

On almost any VPN, this is a simple matter of opening the app or desktop client and choosing the server location from a list.</p><figure><img src=\"https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/Proton_VPN_Mac_interface.png\" data-crop-orig-src=\"https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/Proton_VPN_Mac_interface.png\" style=\"height:1872px;width:3407px;\" alt=\"On Proton VPN, for example, you can switch locations by clicking the name of any country in the list on the left.\" data-uuid=\"c0ecfb77-d3b2-4d75-b95e-1db966e6c94e\"/><figcaption>On Proton VPN, for example, you can switch locations by clicking the name of any country in the list on the left.</figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Sam Chapman for Engadget</div></figure><p>However, as with any technology, there are some potential pitfalls. For reference, I&#39;ve laid out the steps below for both desktop and mobile devices.</p><h3 id=\"jump-link-how-to-change-location-on-windows-or-mac\"><strong>How to change location on Windows or Mac</strong></h3><p>Use these steps to change the virtual location of any desktop or laptop device running macOS or Windows. There may be slight variations, but in general, this process works for any top VPN.</p><ol><li><p>Select a VPN provider. You can rely on Engadget&#39;s best VPN list or, if you&#39;re unable to pay for a new subscription right now, our list of the <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/best-free-vpn-120032818.html\" data-i13n=\"cpos:4;pos:1\">best free VPNs</a>. My personal choice is <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/proton-vpn-review-2025-a-nonprofit-service-with-premium-performance-153046073.html\" data-i13n=\"cpos:5;pos:1\">Proton VPN</a>, but there are other good options. Look for a service with fast speeds, modern encryption and a long, non-controversial record in the industry.</p></li><li><p>Create an account with the VPN and save your username and password. Unless it&#39;s a forever-free service, this is when you&#39;ll be asked to pay for a subscription. If you&#39;re sure about your provider, you can save a lot by going with a long-term deal. See our list of the <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/deals/the-best-vpn-deals-up-to-88-percent-off-protonvpn-surfshark-expressvpn-nordvpn-and-more-120056445.html\" data-i13n=\"cpos:6;pos:1\">best VPN deals</a> for ideas.</p></li><li><p>Download the VPN app. It&#39;s best to go through the VPN&#39;s website, even if you&#39;re on Mac — in rare cases, the App Store versions can be outdated or short on features. Look for a download center on the site, and make sure you enter it while logged in.</p></li><li><p>Install the VPN app. Most VPNs have an installation flow built in, so all you have to do is follow the steps. If the VPN asks you to change your settings or grant it permissions, do it; this installs the tools it needs to do its job.</p></li><li><p>Open the VPN app and find your way around the user interface. At a minimum, make sure you know how to connect, disconnect and open the location selection menu.</p></li><li><p>Connect to a server in the location where you want your internet connection to appear to originate. If you&#39;re trying to get around local restrictions, you can just pick any nearby country without that censorship — for example, if you&#39;re in China, then Japan, South Korea or Singapore will work. If you&#39;re after content from a specific country, choose a server in that country.</p></li><li><p>Get online through a browser or connected app as you normally would. To make sure your location has actually changed, use a site like <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"link\" href=\"https://whatismyipaddress.com/\" data-i13n=\"cpos:7;pos:1\">WhatIsMyIPAddress</a> to check where you&#39;re coming from.</p></li><li><p>When you want to use your real location again, disconnect from the VPN or choose a server in the county you&#39;re in.</p></li></ol><p>It&#39;s not necessary, but I also recommend activating your VPN&#39;s kill switch if there is one. VPN servers aren&#39;t perfect, and they do drop connections from time to time. If this happens, an active kill switch also cuts off your internet connection so your real location isn&#39;t visible for a millisecond.</p><h3 id=\"jump-link-how-to-change-location-on-iphone-or-android\"><strong>How to change location on iPhone or Android</strong></h3><p>The process for using a VPN to change your virtual location on mobile is pretty similar to how it&#39;s done on desktop. Again, while individual installation flows have their own quirks, the following steps are broadly applicable to any iOS or Android VPN.</p><ol><li><p>Pick a VPN provider you like. The best VPNs also tend to be the best for mobile, including Proton VPN, <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/vpn-review-expressvpn-2023-gaming-streaming-160052492.html\" data-i13n=\"cpos:8;pos:1\">ExpressVPN</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/surfshark-vpn-review-a-fast-vpn-for-casual-users-170022675.html\" data-i13n=\"cpos:9;pos:1\">Surfshark</a>. On mobile, you can use app store reviews and comments to research. Make sure you&#39;re getting the real version of your chosen VPN and not a similarly named one trying to piggyback.</p></li><li><p>Download the VPN from the Apple App Store or Google Play Store. At this point, if you haven&#39;t paid yet, you may be able to take advantage of a free trial by opening the app and proceeding through the setup flow. This is a good time to test if the VPN is changing your location in ways that can&#39;t be seen through.</p></li><li><p>Follow the VPN&#39;s instructions to create an account, including paying for a subscription if necessary.</p></li><li><p>Take some time to learn to use the VPN app. Mobile interfaces have to pack more features into a smaller space, usually relying on tabs.

However, the benefits of location masking far outweigh the small amount of extra work. Hiding your IP address — and your location along with it — is one of the most impactful <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/12-steps-you-can-take-right-now-to-be-safer-online-130008335.html\" data-i13n=\"cpos:12;pos:1\">steps you can take to stay safe online</a>.</p><p>Concealing your IP address has massive benefits on its own, even if you use one close to your real location (which gets you shorter loading times). Lots of web services track you without your consent, frequently for advertising purposes. Some of this is done through third-party cookies, but a lot of it starts with building profiles about your IP address.</p><p>Illicit actors can also take advantage of your IP address and its geolocation. A hacker can track you down to within your ZIP code — though an IP address can&#39;t pinpoint your location to the square foot, it makes it much easier to narrow down where you live. Even with just your IP address, hackers can launch DDoS attacks against you, use the IP to make fake social media accounts in your name or even call in <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/miffed-rainbow-six-seige-player-sentenced-for-swatting-ubisoft-montreals-offices-201200746.html\" data-i13n=\"cpos:13;pos:1\">SWAT teams to your location</a>.</p><figure><img src=\"https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/ExpressVPN_Netflix_UK.png\" data-crop-orig-src=\"https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/ExpressVPN_Netflix_UK.png\" style=\"height:1537px;width:3038px;\" alt=\"By changing my location to the UK using ExpressVPN, I can see shows on Netflix that aren&#39;t listed in the US.\" data-uuid=\"6448824f-e64b-4d18-8249-23db20dc5ddd\"/><figcaption>By changing my location to the UK using ExpressVPN, I can see shows on Netflix that aren&#39;t listed in the US.</figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Sam Chapman for Engadget</div></figure><p>Although masking your virtual location can be vital to staying safe online, there are other practical and even fun reasons to do it. For one thing, when traveling abroad, you might want to use a site only available in your home country. Simply connect to a server located near home and you can use your bank account and local streaming libraries as normal.</p><p>If you&#39;re home, there are lots of benefits to being virtually in another region. You can see a foreign country&#39;s streaming libraries and shop for deals that may only be available in its currency. You can also get around any nationwide online censorship and potentially download banned apps. Just be sure to be aware of your local laws to know if doing so is merely frowned upon, or if it’s truly against the law.</p><h2 id=\"jump-link-can-a-vpn-change-your-gps-location\"><strong>Can a VPN change your GPS location?</strong></h2><p>There&#39;s one more critical point to remember when changing location with a VPN. The VPN server only changes your IP address and the physical location associated with it. It does not change the GPS location your device might be broadcasting.</p><p>GPS data can leak out in a few ways. Tablets and phones have location services turned on by default, and as anyone who&#39;s heard a true crime podcast knows, they can also give away your location by contacting cell towers. Web browsers often have similar features. Websites can also use HTML5 geolocation to access your GPS — provided you give permission, but that&#39;s easy to do without thinking.</p><p>Some VPNs, including Surfshark and Windscribe, do have features designed to fool GPS, but they&#39;re not standard. When you&#39;re changing your location with a VPN, make sure to turn off location services and avoid granting any permissions that might reveal where you really are. You can also run a separate GPS spoofing app alongside your VPN.</p><h2 id=\"jump-link-how-to-troubleshoot-a-vpn-thats-not-changing-your-location\"><strong>How to troubleshoot a VPN that&#39;s not changing your location</strong></h2><p>If you&#39;ve found that browsers are still seeing your old IP address while you have a VPN active, or that websites show you the same content when you&#39;re supposed to be virtually abroad, there&#39;s a chance your VPN isn&#39;t actually changing your location. To test if your real position is leaking, start by checking your IP address (with a search engine or WhatIsMyIPAddress). If it matches your home location, something has gone wrong.</p><p>Note that it&#39;s not necessarily a problem if it doesn&#39;t match your home location or the stated location of your VPN server. VPNs use virtual server locations to reach a lot of locations where brick-and-mortar servers aren&#39;t practical — Windscribe, for example, does not have a physical data center in Antarctica.</p><p>If you find that your VPN is leaking your real IP address, try these troubleshooting steps in order. I&#39;ve arranged them roughly from least to most time-intensive.</p><ol><li><p>Disconnect from your VPN and reconnect to the same location. This should hook you up with a different server in that same place. Test your IP again — there&#39;s a good chance the problem was isolated to the first server you tried.</p></li><li><p>Try a new location (skip this step if you need a server in a particular country).</p></li><li><p>Try a different VPN protocol. If you&#39;re using WireGuard, switch to OpenVPN or IKEv2.</p></li><li><p>Make sure location services are turned off.</p></li><li><p>Clear your browser cache and cookies to get rid of any saved information.</p></li><li><p>Test for DNS leaks. Your VPN might accidentally be sending your IP address to a public server to resolve DNS requests. <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"link\" href=\"http://IPleak.org\" data-i13n=\"cpos:14;pos:1\"><a target=\"_blank\" class=\"link\">IPleak.org</a></a> is a good tool for catching this.</p></li><li><p>Try a different VPN. Use a free service like Proton or Windscribe and test for leaks. If the problem reoccurs, it might be coming from inside your network.</p></li><li><p>Contact the helpdesk for your original VPN and inform them about the problem. Get screenshots of the VPN connected to the leaky location next to IP address data confirming the leak.</p></li></ol><p>I&#39;ve already mentioned several VPNs that do a good job of changing your location, but in case you&#39;re here for product advice, here are all my recommendations in one place. My favorite VPN is <strong>Proton VPN,</strong> which is so far the only service to receive full marks on my location-change test. I used 15 of its servers in five different countries to access Netflix. Each time, I saw the destination country&#39;s full content library like I was really there.</p><p><strong>Surfshark </strong>is a close runner-up in this category. It passed 14 out of 15 tests, only slipping up once in Japan — and a quick disconnect and reconnect was enough to fix that. I got equally great results from <strong>ExpressVPN</strong>, only having to retry one server in the UK. <strong>NordVPN </strong>performed perfectly in every location except Nigeria, and that still didn&#39;t leak my real IP address. The problem only seemed to exist on Netflix.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/how-to-change-location-with-a-vpn-140000339.html?src=rss",

This is the first time in its history that the space agency is cutting a mission short due to a medical issue, but it didn’t identify the crew member or divulge the exact situation and its severity. The agency is targeting a return date no earlier than January 14, with the exact schedule depending on the weather. If NASA’s original plan pushes through, the crew will splash down off the coast of California at approximately 3:40 AM on January 15.</p><p>The agency previously <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/science/space/nasa-delays-spacewalk-due-to-a-medical-concern-with-a-crew-member-171900024.html\" data-i13n=\"cpos:3;pos:1\">postponed</a> an International Space Station (ISS) spacewalk scheduled for January 8, citing a medical concern with a crew member that appeared the day before. NASA’s chief health and medical officer, James “JD” Polk, said the affected astronaut is “absolutely stable” and that this isn’t a case of an emergency evacuation. The ISS has a “robust suite of medical hardware” onboard, he said, but not enough for a complete workup to determine a diagnosis. Without a proper diagnosis, NASA doesn’t know if the astronaut’s health could be negatively affected by the environment aboard the ISS. That is why the agency is erring on the side of caution. </p><p>Crew-11 left for the space station on August 1 and was supposed to come back to Earth on or around February 20. After they leave the station, only three people will remain: Two cosmonauts and one astronauts who’ll be in charge of all the experiments currently being conducted on the orbiting lab. The team’s replacement, Crew-12, was supposed to head to the ISS mid-February, but NASA is considering sending the astronauts to the station earlier than that. </p><p><strong>Update, January 10, 2025, 5:15AM ET: </strong>This story has been updated to include Crew-11’s tentative return date.</p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/science/space/nasa-is-ending-crew-11-astronauts-mission-a-month-early-140000750.html?src=rss",

The week began with press conferences from huge companies at the show, mostly filled with AI buzzwords, vague promises and quite little in the way of hard news.</p><p>More than one company even decided to forgo announcing things during their conferences to make way for more AI chatter, only to publish press releases later quietly admitting that, yes, actually, they did make some consumer technology. It&#39;s appropriate, I guess, that as we&#39;re beginning to feel the knock-on cost effects of the AI industry&#39;s insatiable appetite for compute resources — higher utility bills and device prices — companies would rather use their flashy conferences to reinforce AI&#39;s supposedly must-have attributes rather than actually inform the public about their new products.</p><p>We&#39;re by no means AI luddites at Engadget, but it&#39;s fair to say that our team is more excited by tangible products that enrich our lives than iterative improvements to large language models.

It&#39;s portable, has a decent range of about 15 miles — with the option to swap out its battery on the go — and could give wheelchair users greater access to areas that would otherwise be difficult to move about in. It can also keep the wheelchair from speeding up when a person is traveling on a downward slope.</p><p>This feels very much like a product that will actually see the light of day, and could be genuinely helpful.

The over-the-ear hook design allows the earbuds to sit outside of your ear for a clear line to your surroundings. When you need a bit more quiet, the company’s noise reduction tech does well to silence moderate sounds in a cafe, office and more. It’s seriously impressive how much noise reduction you’ll get here, and the fact that nothing is stuck in your ear canals makes them very comfortable to wear. Plus, Shokz improved overall sound quality with new drivers, and tacked on Dolby Atmos for good measure. <em>— Billy Steele, Deputy editor</em></p><h2 id=\"jump-link-best-outdoor-tech-tone-outdoors-t1\">Best outdoor tech: Tone Outdoors T1</h2><figure><img src=\"https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/bestof_tone.jpg\" data-crop-orig-src=\"https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/bestof_tone.jpg\" style=\"height:1080px;width:1920px;\" alt=\"Tone Outdoors T1\" data-uuid=\"3dfa4777-216c-4b20-bffb-a305f3844b7f\" data-display-size=\"standard\"><figcaption>Tone Outdoors T1</figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Whisper Aero</div></figure><p>Outdoor tool companies have increasingly shown up at CES, especially the ones that offer a range of battery-powered gear.

The system is designed to take standard Lego sets and make them more interactive thanks to a tech-packed Smart Brick. Those bricks have a tiny chip the size of a Lego stud that enables things like motion, color and proximity sensing. They also have a tiny speaker that further helps bring Lego builds to life.&nbsp;</p><p>The Smart Brick is mostly a blank slate, but pairing it with Lego&#39;s Smart Tags and Smart Minifigures is what enables these new play scenarios. Unsurprisingly, Lego introduced the Smart Play system alongside Star Wars sets that make these new immersive elements more obvious. An X-Wing piloted by Luke Skywalker can get into a dogfight with Darth Vader&#39;s TIE fighter, and you&#39;ll hear the engines roar to life, the characters exclaim as they come under fire and the spaceship explodes if it gets hit too many times. And Smart Play requires no setup, meaning that the technology packed into the Smart Brick fades away and lets kids (and kids at heart) get down to the business of playing. You don&#39;t need to know how it works — it just does. — <em>Nathan Ingraham, Deputy editor</em></p><h2 id=\"jump-link-best-pc-or-laptop-dell-xps-14--16\">Best PC or laptop: Dell XPS 14 + 16</h2><figure><img src=\"https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/bestof_xps.jpg\" data-crop-orig-src=\"https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/bestof_xps.jpg\" style=\"height:720px;width:1280px;\" alt=\"The Dell XPS 14 and 16.\" data-uuid=\"3837f0f2-cec8-4cc5-82b3-c8558352b1ee\" data-display-size=\"standard\"><figcaption>The Dell XPS 14 and 16.</figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Dell</div></figure><p>In a way, this award is for Dell’s latest flagship laptops but also the company itself.

Dell also streamlined its designs with the larger XPS 16 dropping an entire pound compared to the previous generation. The company even addressed a number of our previous critiques by switching from capacitive touch controls back to a classic row of function keys and reverting to segmented touchpads instead of seamless glass ones that made it hard to keep track of your cursor.&nbsp;</p><p>But perhaps the best part is that Dell isn’t stopping here, because the company also teased a new version of its legendary XPS 13 slated for later this year, the thinnest and lightest member of the family yet.

IXI’s glasses feature an elegant, unique, cameraless eye-tracking system that uses ultra-low-power LEDs and photodiodes to precisely monitor the user&#39;s eye movement and focus convergence. This data drives a liquid crystal lens layer, enabling a focus switch between near and far distances in approximately 0.2 seconds.&nbsp;Focus your gaze elsewhere, and your glasses return to their normal prescription.&nbsp;Think of them as a high-tech take on the often thick and clunky multifocal lenses we’re currently stuck with.</p><p>IXI is now finalizing the production process, developing manufacturing and gaining the necessary medical certification to sell its glasses, but it has already struck deals with lens manufacturers in Europe.

But it could resume its job as a community informer. It could make it easier to notify the public of where these masked thugs are congregating, perhaps even helping others avoid Good&#39;s fate.</p><p>Engadget has reached out to Apple for comment on reinstating ICEBlock; we’ll update if we receive a response.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/its-time-for-apple-to-reinstate-iceblock-220802356.html?src=rss",

They’re packed with modern technology, so they can respond to how you play with them or the sets you build. The Smart Brick has a 4.1mm ASIC chip, which Lego says is smaller than a standard Lego stud. It senses things like motion, orientation and magnetic fields, but also has a tiny built-in speaker, which produces audio “tied to live play actions,” not just canned clips.</p>\n<p>It’s hard to explain it in only a few words (we’ve got a deep-dive hands-on <a data-i13n=\"cpos:2;pos:1\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/lego-smart-play-hands-on-using-smart-brick-technology-to-get-kids-to-play-together-133000740.html\"><ins>right here</ins></a>), but what immediately drew me in was the lack of smartphone pairing and screens. The ability of each part to detect and interact with others can lead to some ridiculous setups, whether it’s ducks and police officers or a helicopter or an X-Wing.</p>\n<p>Naturally, it’s a little pricier than basic Lego, but not out of the realm of being a special gift or birthday present. One of the first sets, with a smart Darth Vader Minifigure, one Smart Brick and one Smart Tag, is $70.</p>\n<p>We&#39;ll be back to our regularly scheduled newsletter next week.

the latest from NVIDIA. While the presentation was more a refresher than a barrage of new announcements, it was a pretty low-key presentation, with lots of AI chat. One announcement was Alpamayo, a family of open-source reasoning models designed to guide autonomous vehicles through difficult driving situations.

But if you went looking for sustainability products, you’re going to have to hunt a bit. </p><p>Last year, the Sustainability section at the Las Vegas Convention Center had 20 booths. This year, there were 38, but that’s in part due to the combination of the energy and sustainability categories. So exhibitors like South Korea’s largest electric utility company, a nuclear power company from the same country and lots of battery manufacturers. There was also an AI data platform booth in the section that had nothing to do with sustainability as far as I can tell. Guess the organizers just ran out of room for all the AI. </p><p>Within the sustainability section, and at other CES venues, I found a few encouraging displays of sustainable products — organizations and devices that were trying to address the <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/the-us-withdraws-from-dozens-of-international-bodies-including-climate-focused-organizations-195259578.html\" data-i13n=\"cpos:5;pos:1\">multitude of problems</a> the world is facing when it comes to energy production, climate and pollution. </p><p>But none of it quite achieved Engadget’s <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/engadgets-best-of-ces-2026-all-the-new-tech-that-caught-our-eye-in-las-vegas-200057123.html\" data-i13n=\"cpos:6;pos:1\">best of CES</a> status this year. Some of what we saw was utility-scale, some wasn’t quite ready for consumer consumption and other stuff was too niche or had too many caveats to make the list. I won’t go so far as to say sustainability is dead at CES, because that sends me into dark downward spirals, but it’s getting sparse out there, friends. </p><p>Here are the companies I saw that had promise and innovative ideas.

This small company has two solutions to create energy for buildings by harnessing the potential energy from existing systems. HydroVigor generates power from water systems. So every time someone washes their hands or flushes a toilet in a building, the roof-top system generates a bit of power. CoolVigor uses the same principles to harness energy from HVAC systems.

You can use the power directly, tie it into your home system, feed it into the grid or hook it up to one of Jackery’s many power stations to save the power for later. The gazebo costs $12,000 and will ship in mid-2026. </p><p>Learn more at <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"link rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=8da55429-10fd-4eee-82eb-d6c6521942a5&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=5d60aade-77de-4a76-affd-d89b1ce8308b&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=jackery&amp;linkText=Jackery&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5qYWNrZXJ5LmNvbS8iLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjVkNjBhYWRlLTc3ZGUtNGE3Ni1hZmZkLWQ4OWIxY2U4MzA4YiIsIm9yaWdpbmFsVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuamFja2VyeS5jb20vIn0&amp;signature=AQAAATTeES63DooitJp1bcNsKSjdj5qb_cSlWYTlEEyRdBvG&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.jackery.com%2F\" data-i13n=\"elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:jackery;elmt:;cpos:13;pos:1\" data-original-link=\"https://www.jackery.com/\">Jackery</a>. </p><h2 id=\"jump-link-bluetti-rv-solar-system\">Bluetti RV Solar System</h2><figure><img src=\"https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/bluetti_power.jpg\" data-crop-orig-src=\"https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/bluetti_power.jpg\" style=\"height:1491px;width:2650px;\" alt=\"Bluetti&#39;s DIY RV Solar power system\" data-uuid=\"dcf4a9c3-8640-47d7-b562-40d2b912e8e4\"><figcaption>Bluetti&#39;s DIY RV Solar power system</figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Amy Skorheim for Engadget</div></figure><p>Bluetti, like Jackery, is known for its vast lineup of portable and fixed power stations and batteries.

But the thing that really caught my eye was its old-school slider form factor. When closed, the Power Keyboard sits on the back of your phone like a thick wireless battery pack — but it satisfyingly slides up to reveal the keyboard like the Palm Pre or BlackBerry Torch smartphones of old. </p><figure><img src=\"https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/DSCF9191.jpg\" data-crop-orig-src=\"https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/DSCF9191.jpg\" style=\"height:1350px;width:2400px;\" alt=\"The magnetic, sliding Clicks Power Keyboard.\" data-uuid=\"0ce88f11-8353-414f-af2a-31e90ceac187\"><figcaption>The magnetic, sliding Clicks Power Keyboard.</figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Nathan Ingraham for Engadget</div></figure><p>The Power Keyboard’s last trick is that it can charge your phone up when attached. The battery itself isn’t huge, so you’re not going to fully recharge a modern smartphone. But it’s still a nice addition for if you need some power in a pinch. You can also set it up so it doesn’t charge your phone and instead uses all the battery to power the keyboard; in that situation, the keyboard will last weeks without a charge. Or you can designate a percentage that can only be used by the keyboard — for example, if the battery pack’s charge drops below 20 percent, it’ll stop charging your phone and instead save that power for the keyboard.</p><figure><img src=\"https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/DSCF9209.jpg\" data-crop-orig-src=\"https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/DSCF9209.jpg\" style=\"height:1350px;width:2400px;\" alt=\"The Clicks Power Keyboard, without a phone attached.\" data-uuid=\"d7e2775d-42b4-4516-ab1c-fc8d809e1e93\"><figcaption>The Clicks Power Keyboard, without a phone attached.</figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Nathan Ingraham for Engadget</div></figure><p>As someone who has never owned a smartphone with a keyboard, I can’t say how good the Clicks keyboard actually is — there would be a definite learning curve before I got comfortable with it. It certainly feels tiny to me, but if you just type on and trust autocorrect you should get the hang of it before too long. Whether the benefits of using a physical keyboard matter are up to you to decide. It’s nice seeing a bigger screen unobstructed by the virtual keyboard, but I feel far too set in my touchscreen ways to consider switching it up. But some people just loved their keyboards, and for them this gadget might hit the spot.</p><p>The Clicks Communicator is the more unexpected of the two new devices the comapny is working on, but without a working demo model I can’t render any judgement about how it will actually work. When it was announced, Clicks specifically said they were targeting people who used multiple devices, a demographic that I wasn’t fully convinced was large enough to justify the Communicator’s existence. But Gadway assured me the company had done plenty of research before moving into the hardware production phase. </p><p>“You&#39;ve got people who are mandated to carry a second device for corporate deploy. Then you&#39;ve got people who are small business owners and want to have a separate phone for their small business,” he said. “In markets like Europe, there&#39;s a requirement for employers to give people the option to have a separate device and create more separation. You&#39;ve got travelers who want a second SIM, and then you&#39;ve got this growing cohort of digital detox, digital minimalism, digital well-being people.” None of those segments might be huge on its own, but add it all up and the Clicks team felt like they had a decent opportunity. </p><figure><img src=\"https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/DSCF9236.jpg\" data-crop-orig-src=\"https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/DSCF9236.jpg\" style=\"height:1350px;width:2400px;\" alt=\"The Clicks Communicator has an LED Light on its side button that you can customize for different notifications.\" data-uuid=\"383d6067-92af-4f84-ac04-08018df735a3\"><figcaption>The Clicks Communicator has an LED Light on its side button that you can customize for different notifications.</figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Nathan Ingraham for Engadget</div></figure><p>The other half of the thought process was making the Communicator different from an iPhone or Pixel — instead of having two essentially identical devices, Clicks wanted to make the Communicator with a distinct focus. “Our thought process was that complementary devices in tech are on the rise,’ Gadway said. “You wear an Oura Ring and you wear a smart watch; you carry an e-reader for reading and a tablet for content consumption. So why shouldn&#39;t your second phone be better at certain things than your first phone instead of just being a straight duplicate?”</p><p>That’s where the squarish, 4-inch touchscreen, keyboard and custom implementation of <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"link rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=b747fd19-ae32-4fad-ae62-84f9d8942106&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;linkText=the+Niagara+Android+launcher&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3BsYXkuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS9zdG9yZS9hcHBzL2RldGFpbHM_aWQ9Yml0cGl0LmxhdW5jaGVyJmhsPWVuX1VTIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJiNzQ3ZmQxOS1hZTMyLTRmYWQtYWU2Mi04NGY5ZDg5NDIxMDYiLCJvcmlnaW5hbFVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vcGxheS5nb29nbGUuY29tL3N0b3JlL2FwcHMvZGV0YWlscz9pZD1iaXRwaXQubGF1bmNoZXImaGw9ZW5fVVMifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAVzMyKyse3TDKidO_Oy2Ej2eR8LRmly8IFYzm1Y2whhd&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fplay.google.com%2Fstore%2Fapps%2Fdetails%3Fid%3Dbitpit.launcher%26hl%3Den_US\" data-i13n=\"elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:;cpos:3;pos:1\" data-original-link=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=bitpit.launcher&amp;hl=en_US\">the Niagara Android launcher</a>, which is a list-based UI rather than a grid of apps. The custom Clicks implementation of it focuses on your messaging apps and quickly triaging through new items (hence the Communicator name). The keyboard itself is touch sensitive and can be swiped across to navigate and take actions on what you see. But the Communicator is just an Android phone at heart which means you can install any apps that you find essential — though its form factor changes what it is best used for. “You can download whatever apps you want, but we&#39;ve optimized it to be better at specific things,” Gadway said. “So, you know, do you want to watch letterboxed TikTok videos on this? Probably not. You could, but it&#39;s not the thing you&#39;re going to reach for to do that. But we&#39;re not going to give you a product that restricts what you can do.”</p><p>The good thing about being a smaller hardware maker is that Clicks doesn’t need to sell millions of these — they’re just interested in offering an alternative for people who might enjoy it, just as they’ve done with their keyboard accessories. Of course, the Communicator is a bigger investment; it’s up for pre-order now for $399 (that’s Pixel 9a territory, for comparison). Once it launches in the second half of the year, we’ll find out if it can find its audience. </p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/the-clicks-co-founder-explains-who-its-tiny-communicator-phone-is-for-170000501.html?src=rss",

It&#39;s one of several companies working on models that can climb stairs, but the Cyber X is a slightly terrifying one since it has large legs that look a bit like chainsaws. The teeth in these legs help provide traction so that the Cyber X can climb stairs that are almost 10 inches high. </p><p>While Dreame’s vacuum positions its legs horizontally to climb stairs with tank-style traction, Roborock’s Saros rover pushes itself upwards on extendable legs to reach higher floors. The legs have wheels on the bottom and knee-like joints — these can help the robot vacuum to raise itself over obstacles on floors too.</p><div><div style=\"left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;\"><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/jXSqguJ3J0c?rel=0\" style=\"top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;\" allowfullscreen scrolling=\"no\" data-provider-name=\"youtube\"></iframe></div></div><p><a target=\"_blank\" class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/home/smart-home/narwals-first-mattress-vacuum-heats-taps-uv-blasts-and-sucks-up-all-the-ick-living-in-your-bed-004929304.html\" data-i13n=\"cpos:120;pos:1\">Narwhal</a> built a new vacuum for your mattress.

Buy enough of the devices it’s presently working on and you’ll exist in an environment of “ambient care,” coddled by the machinery in your home. It sounds positively utopian: When the sensors in your bed know you’ve not slept well and are getting a cold, a <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/home/smart-home/lgs-cloid-robot-can-fold-laundry-and-serve-food-very-slowly-181902306.html\" data-i13n=\"cpos:2;pos:1\">robot</a> will wake you with a glass of freshly squeezed orange juice. When you’re in a rush to get to work, the robot will make you a sandwich for you to eat on the go, sparing you the effort of making it yourself. The more I roamed the halls of the show after that, the more I couldn’t help feeling uneasy about what so many companies here were pitching. To me, the vision of the future on show here is equal parts solitary and infantilized.</p><p>There’s obvious reasons for this: <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/ai/everything-nvidia-announced-at-ces-2026-225653684.html\" data-i13n=\"cpos:3;pos:1\">AI swallowed</a> the tech industry’s oxygen, sapping any chance of innovation in consumer hardware. The advent of <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/computing/ces-2026-intel-hopes-its-core-ultra-series-3-chips-are-the-start-of-a-comeback-000155611.html\" data-i13n=\"cpos:4;pos:1\">Panther Lake</a> is a win for Intel, but it’s not going to enable dramatic changes in how people work with their PCs on a daily basis. The US policy shift away <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/transportation/evs/a-shaky-year-for-american-evs-could-set-the-tone-for-2026-153000210.html\" data-i13n=\"cpos:5;pos:1\">from EVs</a> and toward fossil fuel-powered vehicles, too, means that the big names in auto manufacture have similarly shied away from the show. That left CES full of various robotics startups offering early visions of humanoid robots designed to work on <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/boston-dynamics-unveils-production-ready-version-of-atlas-robot-at-ces-2026-234047882.html\" data-i13n=\"cpos:6;pos:1\">production lines</a>, take care of your home and replace your pet. I saw more than a few stands where booth attendants were pretending to delight in <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.instagram.com/reel/DTRC3lOEg8j/?igsh=NTc4MTIwNjQ2YQ%3D%3D\" data-i13n=\"cpos:7;pos:1\">teaching their wheeled robot pets to play fetch</a>. At least, I <em>hope</em> they were pretending.</p><p>I’m painfully aware of how many devices felt like they were only a hop, skip and a jump away from the Sharper Image catalog. Gadgets that are designed to fill some perceived hole in your life that won’t actually make things better or easier in the long run. I’m leery about denigrating assistive technology that offers a vital lifeline to people with accessibility needs. I’m also leery about knocking devices that may enable people to keep working despite wrestling with long term injuries — I&#39;ve got one eye on the raft of exoskeletons exhibited at the show which might help me work in the garden despite the weakness in my lower back. But I’m also not quite sold on how many <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/home/smart-home/throne-from-the-co-founder-of-whoop-uses-computer-vision-to-study-your-poop-150000606.html\" data-i13n=\"cpos:8;pos:1\">toilet computers</a>, massage chairs and <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xu28o7TF8IE\" data-i13n=\"cpos:9;pos:1\">scootcases</a> we all need in our daily lives.&nbsp;</p><p>There’s also the elephant in the room that many of these innovations seem intent on acting as a replacement, substitute or supplement for real interaction. Robotic panda bears scuttling around your home to save you the effort of caring for a real flesh-and-blood pet. <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/gaming/pc/razer-put-a-waifu-in-a-bottle-at-ces-2026-205315908.html\" data-i13n=\"cpos:10;pos:1\">Holographic AI waifus</a> that will obsequiously respond to whatever you ask of it with nothing but flattery and agreement. The sheer volume of <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/ces-2026-live-updates-on-the-latest-gadgets-at-the-biggest-tech-event-of-the-year-153146311.html\" data-i13n=\"cpos:11;pos:1\">AI Labubus</a> operating as friend, enemy, companion or a combination of all the above. Cuddly home robots that are little more than a <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/home/smart-home/i-cant-get-over-this-goofy-long-necked-cyber-pet-robot-at-ces-175900062.html\" data-i13n=\"cpos:12;pos:1\">tablet on a moveable base</a> that’ll keep your kids entertained so you don’t have to. Yes, I’m being unfair, but sometimes shows like this make me sound like someone’s grandpa angrily insisting you darn kids get off your screens.&nbsp;</p><p>I feel some of these gadgets are specifically designed to enable a degree of detachment from our own bodies. We’re spending so much time getting dopamine from our devices that we’re no longer able to pay attention to how our bodies are feeling. In LG’s vision of the future, moving around for ourselves and making our own food is a thing of the past, which will, surely, put a dent in our physical and mental health. We lose the ability to connect with the people around us because we’ve spent too long being flattered by our AI lackeys. We need a machine to monitor the food we eat and the crap we excrete because we’re not willing to pay attention to what we’re doing. Much in the same way that AI encourages us to take shortcuts rather than enjoy the process of being creative, the rest of the tech industry seemingly wants us to shortcut the fundamentals of life.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ces-2026-offered-a-lonely-vision-of-the-future-160000993.html?src=rss",

The new Nano charger with smart display, which is an upgrade to the existing Nano charger in Anker's lineup, is on sale for $30 right now while you can pre-order it. That's $10 off the regular MSRP, and shipments will start going out on January 20.</p> \n<p>The 45W charger includes a smart display that shows real-time data like power flow, temperature and charging status. It also features \"fun animations to keep things cheerful.\" Anker says it can recognize what's being charged and automatically adjust certain metrics to ensure a longer battery lifespan.</p> <span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span>\n<p>\n <core-commerce id=\"1f0c9e1aa28c4e6cb8e2f5b6045a4e14\" data-type=\"product-list\" data-original-url=\"https://www.anker.com/products/a121d-45w-usb-c-fast-charger-foldable-plug-compact?variant=46070529228950\"></core-commerce></p> \n<p>To that end, it works with just about everything. The company advertises that this charger is a good fit for the iPhone, Apple Watch, AirPods and Samsung devices, among others. The new Nano Charger is on the smaller side, with dual folding prongs that rotate to fit most outlets.</p> \n<p>The deal does require a coupon code, but it's auto-applied at checkout. If that doesn't work, it's <strong>WS24D5XT3DV9</strong>. We haven't gotten a chance to try this one yet, but it looks promising.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/the-new-anker-45w-nano-charger-with-smart-display-from-ces-is-10-off-already-160707620.html?src=rss",

There&#39;s also a dedicated part of the pad&#39;s design for an Apple Watch, which uses a proprietary charging standard, to power up too. Just note that you&#39;ll need a newer model of phone and the latest iOS 26 in order to take full advantage of the 25W charging capability. The wireless pad also comes with both a charging plug and a cable.

In Lego form, our little friends look…kinda strange? I&#39;m not the biggest Lego builder, but I am a rather accomplished architect in <em>Minecraft</em>, so I am well aware of the innate challenge in constructing a rounded shape from square blocks. Take Pikachu, for instance. Part of his appeal is his chubby little cheeks. There are bricks with more rounded sides in this collection that hint at his usual rotundness, but the proportions of his face just feel a little off to me. I had the same reaction to the other figures as well, although Eevee seems to have fared a little better than the others. They&#39;re all sort of cute, but not nearly so cute as they are in other formats. But like I said, Lego is not my personal block of choice, so perhaps I&#39;m in the minority here! If you love these bricky pocket monsters, then roll on over to Lego&#39;s website and snap up these kits faster than a Mewtwo.</p> \n<p>\n <core-commerce id=\"07a593e6a4ec4528b3a5be4a04e3e558\" data-type=\"product-list\" data-original-url=\"https://www.lego.com/en-us/product/pikachu-and-poke-ball-72152\"></core-commerce></p> \n<p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/legos-first-pokemon-sets-are-now-available-for-pre-order-205527102.html?src=rss",

    "title": "Dell revives its XPS laptops after a boneheaded rebranding",
    "body": "<p>Last year, <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/computing/dell-dumps-its-pc-brands-to-be-more-like-apple-194524781.html\" data-i13n=\"cpos:1;pos:1\">Dell killed off all of its PC brands</a>, including the iconic XPS lineup, and replaced them with a simplified naming scheme. It was a move meant to make it easier for people to discern between the company&#39;s many brands, but in reality, it just just made the company&#39;s lineup even more confusing. We called it an unforced error at the time, but after seeing how much Dell&#39;s PC market share fell over 2025, it&#39;s fair to say that rebranding was an absolute marketing disaster. </p><p>So, with its tail between its legs, Dell has returned to CES some welcome news for its fans: <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/computing/laptops/it-took-guts-for-dell-to-admit-its-mistake-heres-how-xps-will-make-its-big-comeback-233248173.html\" data-i13n=\"cpos:2;pos:1\">XPS lives</a>! And the company plans to double-down on the brand in ways it never did before. Today, Dell revealed the new XPS 14 and 16 notebooks, which feature a more practical design than the previous models. There&#39;s a new function row with traditional keys, instead of the odd capacitive buttons that disappeared in sunlight. And while the company is sticking with its &quot;invisible&quot; trackpad, which sits flush alongside the wrist rest, there&#39;s now a light border around the edges that lets you feel exactly where the trackpad begins and ends.</p><div><div style=\"left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;\"><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/eJXQ5B7W2sY?rel=0\" style=\"top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;\" allowfullscreen scrolling=\"no\" data-provider-name=\"youtube\"></iframe></div></div><p>So, in short, Dell seems to have solved most of our recent complaints about the XPS lineup. To signify its commitment to the brand, it&#39;s also emblazoning the XPS logo on all of these new machines, replacing the previous Dell name. That’s something I could never imagine a less humbled Dell doing. </p><p>The redesign also gave Dell room to shave off some weight and thickness from both machines. The XPS 14 weighs around three pounds now, a half-pound lighter than the previous generation, while the XPS 16 weighs 3.6 pounds, a whole pound lighter than before. The new cases make both machines look a lot more like Microsoft’s extra-subtle Surface Laptop, but that’s not necessarily a bad thing. Both systems are powered by Intel’s new Panther Lake Core Ultra Series 3 chips, and they also offer tandem OLED display options.</p><p>Dell also briefly teased the return of a new XPS 13 later this year, which is set to be the company’s thinnest and lightest notebook ever.  Dell says it’ll be cheaper than the XPS has been in the past.</p><p>The new XPS 14 and 16 will be available on January 6, starting at $2,050 and $2,200, respectively. A Dell representative tells us these aren’t entry-level configurations, instead we can expect to see cheaper prices with lower specs in February.</p><p><strong>Update 1/6/26, 12:30p: </strong>Pricing updated to reflecrt new numbers from Dell. Originally, we were told they would start at $1,650 and $1,850.</p><p><strong>Update 1/12, 3:00p: </strong>Added a mention of lower entry-level configurations coming eventually.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/computing/laptops/dell-revives-its-xps-laptops-after-a-boneheaded-rebranding-001028029.html?src=rss",

    "title": "CES 2026 proved the PC industry is hosed this year",
    "body": "<p>Dell&#39;s <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/computing/laptops/dell-revives-its-xps-laptops-after-a-boneheaded-rebranding-001028029.html\" data-i13n=\"cpos:1;pos:1\">XPS 14 currently costs over $2,000</a>. An AMD executive predicts that PC builders will likely make piecemeal upgrades this year, instead of building entirely new systems. And new AI supercomputers from NVIDIA and AMD are gobbling up the RAM market. At CES 2026, it was hard not to notice the dire year ahead for the computing industry, one that will likely lead to higher prices and more limited availability for consumer goods across the board.</p><p>Really, though, the show just confirmed what was apparent since <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/social-media/engadget-podcast-wtf-is-up-with-ram-with-will-smith-from-the-tech-pod-141442002.html\" data-i13n=\"cpos:2;pos:1\">RAM prices skyrocketed over the last few months</a>, driven by demand from AI datacenters. As Samsung&#39;s marketing leader, Wonjin Lee, <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-01-07/samsung-warns-of-price-hikes-as-rising-memory-costs-affect-all\" data-i13n=\"cpos:3;pos:1\">told Bloomberg</a> at CES: &quot;There&#39;s going to be issues around semiconductor supplies, and it&#39;s going to affect everyone. Prices are going up even as we speak.&quot;</p><p>At first, it appeared that Dell&#39;s new XPS 14 and XPS 16 were among the earliest systems hit by these demands. Last year&#39;s models started at $1,699 and $1,899, respectively, and we were initially told the new models would actually come in cheaper at $1,650 and $1,850. At the moment, the XPS 14 starts at $2,050, while the XPS 16 is $2,200. A Dell representative tells us these aren’t entry-level configurations, instead we can expect to see cheaper systems below $2,000 in February. While those prices haven’t been finalized, the reps say it should be similar to the earlier figures we were given.</p><p>It’s also worth noting that it didn&#39;t take much to configure the earlier models upwards of $2,000. It’s just unfortunate that Dell doesn’t have cheaper configurations available for the launch if its new systems, especially since they look so compelling. Meanwhile, Apple still hasn&#39;t budged its $1,599  MacBook Pro 14-inch pricing. At least Dell still comes in cheaper than the $2,499 MacBook Pro 16-inch.</p><p>On the desktop front, AMD&#39;s David McAfee, Corporate Vice President and GM of Client Channel Business, noted that the longevity of the company&#39;s AM4 and AM5 platforms might be a boon for gamers, since they can upgrade their CPUs without buying new RAM kits and motherboards. That allows for a pathway to better performance without paying out the nose for over-priced RAM.</p><p>&quot;I think that will be potentially a trend that we see in 2026 with more component upgrades, as opposed to full system swap outs and, and altogether rebuilds,&quot; he said in a group interview with Engadget and other outlets. &quot;Some of the most popular CPUs that are still running in gamers’ platforms are parts like the 2600 back to the Pinnacle Ridge days, or 3000 series... Stepping even from there into a little bit more modern 5,000 series processors in an AM4 socket and motherboard, there&#39;s a pretty big boost there.&quot;</p><p>McAfee added that around 30 to 40 percent of AMD&#39;s business still revolves around the AM4 platform, even without the specter of a wild memory market.</p><p>&quot;There&#39;s no product that has memory in it that&#39;s immune to some of these forces around DRAM pricing and, and what it&#39;s doing to the market,&quot; he said, when asked about potential GPU price increases. &quot;I think the, the truth is the volatility that we&#39;ve seen over the past two months or so has really been unprecedented.&quot; </p><p>Looking ahead, he said he expects prices to settle within the first three to six months of the year, but he didn&#39;t discuss his reasoning further. As an aside, he also noted that AMD&#39;s X3D chips, which feature 3D V-cache, actually don&#39;t see much of a hit from slower RAM. Their high amounts of onboard L2 and L3 cache make up for less ideal memory transfer speeds, McAfee said.</p><p>That McAfee commented at all about the state of RAM is noteworthy. Every PC maker I’ve asked, including Dell and Acer, refused to comment on the volatile state of the memory industry ahead of CES. Perhaps they were hoping things would calm down before they had to price their new systems. Ultimately, they’re beholden to an increasingly limited supply of RAM. </p><p>And where is all that memory going? At CES, NVIDIA announced its new <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"link\" href=\"https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/inside-the-nvidia-rubin-platform-six-new-chips-one-ai-supercomputer/#:~:text=Table_title:%20From%20NVIDIA%20Grace%20to%20Vera%E2%80%94scaling%20the,CPU:%20900GB/s%20%7C%20Vera%20CPU:%201.8TB/s%20%7C\" data-i13n=\"cpos:4;pos:1\">Vera Rubin AI supercomputer</a>, which supports up to 54TB of RAM across 36 Vera CPUs and 20.7TB of memory across 72 GPUs. AMD, as well, announced its <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.amd.com/en/blogs/2026/from-ces-2026-to-yottaflops-why-the-amd-keynote.html\" data-i13n=\"cpos:5;pos:1\">new Helios AI rack</a>, which supports up to  31TB of memory across 72 AMD Instinct MI455X GPUs. Given the endless appetite for computing to power AI model building and inferencing, there’s likely going to be a significant demand for these beastly systems.</p><p>Put simply: Our global supply of memory is being sacrificed to appease the AI industry. That’s good news for the likes of OpenAI, Microsoft and NVIDIA, but bad news for anyone who cares about PCs and the consumer products we use every day. Get ready for a year of price hikes.  </p><p><strong>Update 1/12, 3:00p: </strong>Added a mention of lower entry-level configurations coming eventually.</p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/computing/ces-2026-proved-the-pc-industry-is-hosed-this-year-174500314.html?src=rss",

Starting today, Anthropic is giving regular people a way to take advantage of those capabilities, with the release of a new preview feature called <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"link\" href=\"https://urldefense.com/v3/__http://claude.com/blog/__;!!Op6eflyXZCqGR5I!H4Kg5gp_7yMadnW8YNEBXhHxFfRXLlqiUWXMTjA_hFLzMfx0bTA_OeGZT1TyI4CviOt0JcJuN-CbfRfApB7i3w$\" data-i13n=\"cpos:2;pos:1\">Claude Cowork</a>.</p><p>The company is billing Cowork as &quot;a simpler way for anyone — not just developers — to work with Claude.&quot; After you give the system access to a folder on your computer, it can read, edit or create new files in that folder on your behalf. </p><p>Anthropic gives a few different example use cases for Cowork. For instance, you could ask Claude to organize your downloads folder, telling it to rename the files contained within to something that&#39;s easier to parse at a glance. Another example:  you could use Claude to turn screenshots of receipts and invoices into a spreadsheet for tracking expenses. Cowork can also navigate websites — provided you install <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/ai/claudes-chrome-plugin-is-now-available-to-all-paid-users-221024295.html\" data-i13n=\"slk:Claude in Chrome;cpos:3;pos:1\">Claude’s Chrome plugin</a> — and make can use Anthropic&#39;s <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"link\" href=\"https://claude.com/connectors\" data-i13n=\"cpos:4;pos:1\">Connectors framework</a> to access third-party apps like Canva. </p><div><div style=\"left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;\"><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/WBNZpAWhw5E?rel=0\" style=\"top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;\" allowfullscreen scrolling=\"no\" data-provider-name=\"youtube\"></iframe></div></div><p>&quot;Cowork is designed to make using Claude for new work as simple as possible. You don’t need to keep manually providing context or converting Claude’s outputs into the right format,&quot; the company said. &quot;Nor do you have to wait for Claude to finish before offering further ideas or feedback: you can queue up tasks and let Claude work through them in parallel.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p> If the idea of granting Claude access to your computer sounds ill-advised, Anthropic says Claude &quot;can’t read or edit anything you don’t give it explicit access to.&quot; However, the company <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"link\" href=\"https://urldefense.com/v3/__http://claude.com/resources/tutorials/claude-cowork-a-research-preview__;!!Op6eflyXZCqGR5I!H4Kg5gp_7yMadnW8YNEBXhHxFfRXLlqiUWXMTjA_hFLzMfx0bTA_OeGZT1TyI4CviOt0JcJuN-CbfRe6TM4kUQ$\" data-i13n=\"cpos:5;pos:1\">does note</a> the system can &quot;take potentially destructive actions,&quot; such as deleting a file that is important to you or misinterpreting your instructions. For that reason, Anthropic suggests it&#39;s best to give &quot;very clear&quot; guidance to Claude.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Anthropic isn’t the first to offer a computer agent. Microsoft, for example, has been pushing Copilot hard for nearly three years, despite <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/ai/it-seems-like-most-windows-users-dont-care-for-copilot-195500516.html\" data-i13n=\"cpos:6;pos:1\">seemingly limited adoption</a>. For Anthropic, the challenge will be convincing people these tools are useful where others have failed. The fact Claude Code has been universally loved by programmers may make that task easier.   </p><p>For now, Anthropic is giving users of its pricey <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/ai/anthropics-max-plan-offers-nearly-unlimited-claude-usage-for-200-per-month-170032710.html\" data-i13n=\"cpos:7;pos:1\">Claude Max</a> subscription first access to the preview. If you want to try Cowork for yourself, you&#39;ll also need a Mac with the Claude macOS app installed. For everyone else, you’ll need to join a wait list. &nbsp; &nbsp; </p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/anthropic-made-a-version-of-its-coding-ai-for-regular-people-193000363.html?src=rss",

Disney+ brings a vast library of animated classics, blockbuster franchises and exclusive content from Marvel, Pixar, Star Wars and National Geographic. It’s the place to stream nearly every Star Wars film and series, plus the full Marvel Cinematic Universe lineup and Disney’s most recent theatrical releases.</p> \n<p>Hulu balances things out with a more adult-oriented lineup of current TV shows, next-day network episodes and a growing roster of award-winning originals. The platform hosts series like <em>The Bear,</em> <em>The Handmaid’s Tale</em> and <em>Only Murders in the Building</em>, alongside comedies, thrillers and documentaries that regularly feature in awards conversations. It’s also the home for next-day streaming of ABC and FX shows, making it especially useful if you’ve already cut the cable cord but still want to keep up with primetime TV.</p> \n<p>The Duo Basic bundle ties these two services together under a single subscription, offering a simple way to expand your library without juggling multiple accounts. This tier includes ads on both platforms, but the trade-off is significant savings compared with paying for each service separately. For many households, that’s an acceptable compromise when it means access to such a wide range of content.</p> \n<p><em>Follow </em><a data-i13n=\"cpos:3;pos:1\" href=\"https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals\"><em>@EngadgetDeals</em></a><em> on X for the latest </em><a data-i13n=\"cpos:4;pos:1\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/deals/\"><em>tech deals</em></a><em> and </em><a data-i13n=\"cpos:5;pos:1\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/best-tech/\"><em>buying advice</em></a><em>.</em></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/the-disney-hulu-bundle-is-on-sale-for-10-for-one-month-right-now-192814784.html?src=rss",

    "body": "<p>If you&#39;re looking to up your privacy game on the internet in the new year, you can do so for a little less than usual thanks to <a data-i13n=\"cpos:1;pos:1\" href=\"https://checkout.expressvpn.com/order\">ExpressVPN&#39;s</a> latest deal. Its two-year plans are up to 78 percent off right now: the Advanced tier is on sale for $101 for two years, plus four additional free months. That works out to $3.59 per month during the promotional period.</p> \n<p>We’ve consistently liked ExpressVPN because it’s fast, easy to use and widely available across a large global server network. In fact, it&#39;s our current pick for <a data-i13n=\"cpos:2;pos:1\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/best-vpn-130004396.html\">best premium VPN</a>. One of the biggest drawbacks has always been its high cost, and this deal temporarily solves that issue.</p> <span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span>\n<p>\n <core-commerce id=\"e8bfbbd20bb1436c83f85e60232ea509\" data-type=\"product-list\" data-original-url=\"https://checkout.expressvpn.com/order\"></core-commerce></p> \n<p>In our <a data-i13n=\"cpos:3;pos:1\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/expressvpn-review-2025-fast-speeds-and-a-low-learning-curve-160052884.html\">review</a> we were able to get fast download and upload speeds, losing only 7 percent in the former and 2 percent in the latter worldwide. We found that it could unblock Netflix anywhere, and its mobile and desktop apps were simple to operate. We gave ExpressVPN an overall score of 85 out of 100.</p> \n<p>The virtual private network service now has three tiers. Basic is cheaper with fewer features, while Pro costs more and adds extra perks like support for 14 simultaneous devices and a password manager. Advanced sits in the middle and includes the password manager but only supports 12 devices.</p> \n<p>The Basic plan is $78 right now for 28 months, down from $363, and the Pro plan is $168, down from $560. That&#39;s 78 percent and 70 percent off, respectively. All plans carry a 30-day money-back guarantee for new users, so you can try it without committing long term if you’re on the fence.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/expressvpn-deal-two-year-plans-are-up-to-78-percent-off-180602243.html?src=rss",

Just use the code <strong>NEWYEAR2026</strong> at checkout to get the discount.</p> \n<p>Monarch Money makes for a capable and detailed budgeting companion. You can use the service via apps for iOS, Android, iPadOS or the web, and Monarch also offers a Chrome extension that can sync your Amazon and Target transactions and automatically categorize them. Like other budgeting apps, Monarch Money lets you connect multiple financial accounts and track your money based on where you spend it over time. Monarch offers two different approaches to tracking budgeting (flexible and category budgeting) depending on what fits your life best, and the ability to add a budget widget on your phone so you can know how you&#39;re tracking that month.</p> <span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span>\n<p>\n <core-commerce id=\"78691f6e9a994323adf7b4c97f1ff66d\" data-type=\"product-list\" data-original-url=\"https://www.monarch.com/\"></core-commerce></p> \n<p>How budgeting apps turn your raw transactions into visuals you can understand at a glance is one of the big things that differentiates one app from another, and Monarch Money offers multiple graphs and charts to look at for things like spending, investments or categories of your choice based on how you&#39;ve labelled your expenses. The app can also monitor the spending of you and your partner all in one place, to make it easier to plan together.</p> \n<p>The main drawbacks Engadget found in testing Monarch Money were the app&#39;s learning curve, and the differences in features (and bugginess) between Monarch&#39;s web and mobile versions. Still, for 50 percent off, the Monarch Money is well worth experimenting with if you&#39;re trying to save money in 2026, especially if you want to do it collaboratively with a partner.</p> \n<p><em>Follow </em><a data-i13n=\"cpos:3;pos:1\" href=\"https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals\"><em>@EngadgetDeals</em></a><em> on X for the latest </em><a data-i13n=\"cpos:4;pos:1\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/deals/\"><em>tech deals</em></a><em> and </em><a data-i13n=\"cpos:5;pos:1\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/best-tech/\"><em>buying advice</em></a><em>.</em></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/apps/monarch-money-is-offering-50-percent-off-its-budgeting-app-for-new-users-204507767.html?src=rss",

A similar situation happened that same year in July on a domestic <a data-i13n=\"cpos:9;pos:1\" href=\"https://www.the-independent.com/travel/delta-lithium-battery-explosion-b2785087.html\">Delta flight, </a>and again in August on a transatlantic <a data-i13n=\"cpos:10;pos:1\" href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/video-smoke-plane-cabin-midflight-portable-phone-charger-fire/\">KLM flight</a>.

If the battery pack isn’t actively in use, however, most rules allow them to stay in your carry-on bag in the overhead bin. Before flying, it’s wise to check your airline’s policies.</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-capacity\"><strong>Capacity</strong></h3> \n<p>If you just need to keep a smartphone from dying before you can make it home, just about <a data-i13n=\"cpos:13;pos:1\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/computing/accessories/best-power-bank-143048526.html\">any of the best power banks will do</a>. But if you need to revive multiple devices or the substantial battery of a laptop, you’ll want something with a high milliamp-hour​​ (mAh) capacity. A power bank capable of delivering enough power to a laptop will have a capacity between 20,000 and 27,000 mAh.</p> \n<p>If you want something even bigger than a laptop power bank, and don’t need to fly with it, you’ll likely want to look into portable power stations. These can be the size of a car battery or larger and can potentially fuel an entire weekend away.</p> \n<p>Another thing to keep in mind is that the capacity listed in a power bank&#39;s specs is not what will be delivered to your devices. As I mentioned, the capacity of these banks is around 25,000mAh. Even the huge battery on a 16-inch MacBook Pro or a Dell XPS 16 has a mAh rating of around 5,000 - 6,000mAh, so you might think you’d get five full charges but in reality, you only get about a single 70-percent charge. The voltage is different (typically 3.7V for the power bank and 11.4V for a laptop) which makes the watt-hours, or the amount of energy each battery can hold, different (working out to 92Wh for the battery and 72Wh for the built-in laptop batteries). On top of that, in order to feed a charge from a power bank to a laptop, a voltage conversion takes place and that dissipates a decent amount of energy.</p> \n<p>Without turning this into a physics lesson, this all means that a power bank with a 25,000mAh (or 92Wh) capacity will typically fill a 5,000mAh (or 72Wh) laptop battery to about 75 percent. In my tests, I averaged about a 60-percent efficiency rate between a power bank’s listed capacity and the actual charge delivered.</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-ports\"><strong>Ports</strong></h3> \n<p>Every large power bank I’ve tested has at least three USB ports, with a mix of USB-C and USB-A, which should cover nearly any portable device you need to recharge — earbuds, phones, tablets, laptops, you name it. In addition to the different plug formats, some ports supply power at different wattages. For example, one built-in USB-C port might be rated for 60 watts, while the one next to it is rated for 100 watts. So if you’ve got a device that’s capable of 70W fast charging, such as the new MacBook Air, you’d want to opt for the 100W port to get the best charging speeds possible.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Note that devices with a smaller wattage draw won’t be negatively affected by connecting to ports with high ratings. For example, a Galaxy S24 Ultra, capable of 45W super fast charging, is perfectly compatible with the 100W port. A device will only draw what it can take, regardless of what a port can supply. Just remember that the port, device <em>and</em> charging cable need to be at or above the desired wattage rating to achieve maximum charging rates.</p> \n<p>Some of these larger batteries also have AC ports. It might seem like a natural fit to plug in your laptop’s power adapter for a recharge. But really, the AC port should only be for devices that can’t use USB — such as a lamp or a printer. Plugging a power adapter into the AC port only wastes energy through conversion. First, the battery converts its DC power to supply the port with AC power, then the power adapter converts that AC power back to DC so your laptop can take it in. And as you’ll remember from physics class, each time energy is converted, some is lost to heat and other dissipations. Better to cut out the middleman and just send that DC power straight from the battery to the device.</p> \n<p>Also, you can use more than one port at a time with these devices; just remember that the speed of whatever you’re charging will likely go down, and of course, the battery is going to drain proportionally to what you’re refilling.</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-wireless-charging\"><strong>Wireless charging</strong></h3> \n<p>Since I first started testing portable power banks a few years ago, wireless charging capabilities have noticeably improved. The first few I tried were painfully slow and not worth recommending. Now the wireless pads built into power banks are impressively fast — particularly, in my experience, when charging Samsung Galaxy phones (though the lack of a stabilizing magnetic connection like Apple’s MagSafe means they only work when rested flat on a pad). Most wireless charging connections can be used while other ports are also being employed, making them convenient for some mobile battlestation setups.</p> \n<p>Of course, wireless charging is always less efficient than wired, and recharging from an external battery is less efficient in general. If you want to waste as little energy as possible, you’re better off sticking to wired connections.</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-design\"><strong>Design</strong></h3> \n<p>All power banks are designed to be portable, but there’s a big difference between a pocket-friendly 5,000mAh battery and one of these laptop-compatible bruisers. Most of the latter weigh between a pound and a half to two pounds, which is a considerable addition to a backpack. Many of the options listed here have a display to tell you how much charge remains in the battery, which is helpful when you’re trying to judiciously meet out charges to your devices. If a bank has a wireless connection, the pad is usually on the flat top and any available AC connection is usually at one end. Both may require you to engage those charging methods. Don’t be like me and grumble loudly that you got a bum unit without pressing (and sometimes double pressing) all the buttons first.</p> \n<h2 id=\"jump-link-how-we-test-portable-laptop-chargers\">How we test portable laptop chargers</h2> \n<p>For the past three years, I’ve been testing and using dozens of portable batteries for our <a data-i13n=\"cpos:14;pos:1\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/best-power-bank-143048526.html\">other battery guide</a>. Some of those batteries include the higher-capacity power banks you see here. I also got a hold of a few extra banks just for this guide to make sure we covered what’s available. I went for brands I’m already familiar with, as well as battery packs from well-received manufacturers I hadn’t tried before (like UGREEN and Lion Energy). I only considered banks with at least a 20,000mAh capacity and mostly stuck with those that rated 25,000mAh and higher.</p> \n<p>Here’s everything we tested:</p> \n<ul> \n <li><p><a

\n<p>I tested each power bank with an Apple phone (iPhone 15 or 16), an Android phone (Galaxy S23 Ultra), a tablet (M1 iPad Air) and a laptop (16-inch MacBook Pro with the M1 Pro chip). Even though these banks can charge multiple devices at once, I refilled one at a time, to make side-by-side comparisons more straightforward. I drained the batteries of the phones and tablets to between zero and five percent and then didn’t use any device as it refilled.</p> \n<p>For the MacBook, I let it run down to 10 percent before plugging in the power bank. That&#39;s when most laptops give display a “connect to power” warning, as draining any battery to empty will compromise the battery life. I then used it as one might in a mobile office, with a Bluetooth keyboard and mouse, while connected to Wi-Fi and a VPN.</p> \n<p>For each test, I noted how long a completely charged battery took to get a device back to full and how much of the battery’s capacity was used up in one charge. I also noted things like portability, apparent durability, helpful features and overall design.</p> \n<p>For reference, here are the battery capacities of the devices I used:</p> \n<ul> \n <li><p>iPhone 15: 3,349mAh</p></li> \n <li><p>Galaxy S23 Ultra: 4,855mAh</p></li> \n <li><p>iPad Air (5th gen): 7,729mAh</p></li> \n <li><p>16-inch M1 Pro MacBook Pro: 27,027mAh</p></li> \n</ul> \n<h2 id=\"jump-link-other-laptop-power-banks-we-tested\">Other laptop power banks we tested</h2> \n<p><strong>HyperJuice 245W</strong></p> \n<p>Hyper’s <a data-i13n=\"elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Hyper;elmt:;cpos:27;pos:1\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=2c93a509-c37a-4798-b978-795281692d23&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=c803d2c4-bcfe-4f4a-8b7d-1f390c4e3c3d&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Hyper&amp;linkText=HyperJuice+245W&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5oeXBlcnNob3AuY29tL3Byb2R1Y3RzL2h5cGVyanVpY2UtMjQ1dy11c2ItYy1iYXR0ZXJ5LXBhY2siLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6ImM4MDNkMmM0LWJjZmUtNGY0YS04YjdkLTFmMzkwYzRlM2MzZCIsIm9yaWdpbmFsVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuaHlwZXJzaG9wLmNvbS9wcm9kdWN0cy9oeXBlcmp1aWNlLTI0NXctdXNiLWMtYmF0dGVyeS1wYWNrIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAaz3PR-XqcBdnqO82nXy1rrlde5SZd2vCx9OZRQD-8m2&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hypershop.com%2Fproducts%2Fhyperjuice-245w-usb-c-battery-pack\" class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" data-original-link=\"https://www.hypershop.com/products/hyperjuice-245w-usb-c-battery-pack\">HyperJuice 245W</a> brick looks great and has a hefty 27,000mAh capacity. The four USB-C ports can combine to output 245W of power and it got my MacBook Pro from nearly dead to 75 percent before depleting itself. When testing it with a Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra, the handset got back up to a full charge in just over an hour. The screen tells you what each port is doing as well as displaying the amount of charge remaining in the pack itself.</p> \n<p>But the lack of port variety makes it feel less versatile than other picks on this list — the price is higher than our other options, too.</p> \n<h2 id=\"jump-link-laptop-power-bank-faqs\">Laptop power bank FAQs</h2> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-how-do-laptop-power-banks-differ-from-phone-power-banks\"><strong>How do laptop power banks differ from phone power banks?</strong></h3> \n<p>The main difference is size. Phone power banks tend to have a capacity ranging from 5,000mAh to 20,000mAh and laptop powerbanks are typically rated between 20,000mAh and 27,000mAh. There’s no official definition, however. Laptop batteries are simply larger and need a bigger supply of power to give them a meaningful charge.</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-how-do-you-fast-charge-a-power-bank\"><strong>How do you fast charge a power bank?</strong></h3> \n<p>You can charge a power bank exactly as fast as the power bank’s internal mechanisms will allow. Most batteries are limited in how quickly they can accept and deliver a charge to avoid dangerously overheating. But to make sure you’re charging a bank as quickly as possible, make sure the wall adapter and the USB-C cable you are using have a high wattage rating — using a 5W power brick and a 10W cable will take a lot longer to refill your bank than a 65W wall charger and a 100W cord.</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-what-size-power-bank-do-i-need-for-a-laptop\"><strong>What size power bank do I need for a laptop?</strong></h3> \n<p>Look for a power bank with a rating of at least 20,000mAh. Slightly smaller batteries may work, but they won’t deliver a significant charge laptops.</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-how-many-mah-to-charge-a-laptop\"><strong>How many mAh to charge a laptop?</strong></h3> \n<p>A milliamp hour (mAh) is how much a battery can hold, and most portable batteries list their capacity using mAh. If you get a battery rated at 20,000mAh or above, it should be able to charge your laptop.</p> \n<p>Using mAh to discuss laptop batteries can be confusing.

    "title": "The CES companies hoping your brain is the next big thing in computing",
    "body": "<p>At every CES I’ve ever been to, there’s been one or two gadgets promising to boost your mental health. In recent years, the number of companies making forays into this space has grown, and will likely continue to do so in the future. Could it be, much like the number of people wearing heart-monitoring wearables today, everyone will be strapping an EEG to their skulls a decade or so down the line? It’s more likely than you think, so it’s worth asking what these devices are good for, what benefit they could bring, and where does the science end and the hype begin.</p><p>An Electroencephalogram (EEG) is a clinical tool to monitor the electrical activity of our brains. Put very simply, our minds are constantly moving ions around, and when they reach the scalp, it’s possible to measure those ions. By placing electrodes on the scalp, you can record the changes in voltages pushed out by our brains more or less in real time. These voltages are commonly grouped into categories, which are often described as <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"link\" href=\"https://nin.nl/about-the-brain/brain-waves/\" data-i13n=\"cpos:1;pos:1\">brain waves</a>. Each one <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/agricultural-and-biological-sciences/brain-waves\" data-i13n=\"cpos:2;pos:1\">represents</a> a different state of mind: Gamma (hard thinking), Beta (anxious or active), Alpha (relaxed), Theta (creative, or dreaming) and Delta (asleep).&nbsp;</p><p><a target=\"_blank\" class=\"link\" href=\"https://profiles.ucl.ac.uk/2747-karl-friston\" data-i13n=\"cpos:3;pos:1\">Professor Karl Friston</a> at University College London is one of the world’s most influential neuroscientists and an expert in brain imaging. He explained that these technologies can be used to diagnose issues both in the structure and function of the brain. And while there are many technologies which can look at how our brains work, “we’re a long way away from understanding the brain like we understand the heart.” Broadly speaking, EEGs are a fairly simple tool for looking at how our minds work, but they have one benefit over more complex methods such as fMRI (functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging), since they work in real time.</p><p>Consumer-use EEGs are nothing new — in 2011 I tested the <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2011-09-28-zeo-mobile-turns-phones-into-a-sleep-clinic-aids-in-advanced-po.html\" data-i13n=\"cpos:4;pos:1\">Zeo Mobile</a>, a small device which you stuck to your forehead and wore overnight. It monitored how well you slept and sounded an alarm when you were at the top of a sleep cycle, so you woke up pretty easily. It worked well but with one downside: It’s hard to sleep with a hard plastic puck stuck to your forehead.</p><p>EEGs are more recently used as part of brain computer interfaces, or for neurofeedback tools to help you calibrate the quality of your meditation. InteraXon, for instance, makes the <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/wearables/muses-new-wearable-eeg-knows-how-hard-youre-thinking-120041154.html\" data-i13n=\"cpos:5;pos:1\">Muse</a> headbands which will monitor your brain waves, telling you when you shift states. Last year, EEG startup Neurable partnered with Master &amp; Dynamic to launch the <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/neurables-brainwave-tracking-master--dynamic-headphones-tell-you-when-to-take-a-break-120004736.html\" data-i13n=\"cpos:6;pos:1\">MW75S Neuro</a>, a pair of high-end headphones designed to track your focus levels. When your attention starts to wane, the system will alert you, advising you to take a rest with the hope of alleviating burnout.</p><figure><img src=\"https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/eeg-neurablemeditation.jpg\" data-crop-orig-src=\"https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/eeg-neurablemeditation.jpg\" style=\"height:1200px;width:1800px;\" alt=\"Neurable\" data-uuid=\"30ad23d1-6c56-4a60-aec7-95ae6e6ac554\"/><figcaption>Neurable</figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Daniel Cooper for Engadget</div></figure><p>At CES this year, Neurable announced a partnership with HP’s gaming arm HyperX to produce EEG headsets with specific benefits for gamers. As gamers are looking for any way to improve their performance, the company has developed algorithms and training programs to help. You might already know that being in a place of high stress isn’t great for your concentration and focus. Consequently, Neurable research scientist Dr. Alicia Howell-Munson walked me through a system that encourages you to reach a state of calm focus with demonstrable improvements in reaction time and accuracy. It’s a system that was initially designed in partnership with Singapore’s Air Force to help ensure pilots remain in a state of calm focus.&nbsp;</p><p>I sat through this demo myself, initially testing my skills in Aimlabs (a tool people use to test their reflexes) where my accuracy and reaction times were measured. Then, while wearing Neurable’s headset, I had to practice focusing my attention on a galaxy of dots, the greater my focus, the slower and closer together the dots got. That wasn’t an easy process, and it took me nearly five minutes to reach the point where I could push all of the dots to coalesce into a single point on the screen. But, when I had, I retook the shooting gallery, and saw dramatic spikes in my performance. My accuracy increased from 91.3 to 99.1 percent, while my reaction time fell from 623ms to 532ms.&nbsp;</p><figure><img src=\"https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/eeg-nurablehyperx.jpg\" data-crop-orig-src=\"https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/eeg-nurablehyperx.jpg\" style=\"height:1200px;width:1800px;\" alt=\"Neurable HyperX headset\" data-uuid=\"faf3e60d-a791-4a8b-8e58-e2c86e36f5dc\"/><figcaption>Neurable HyperX headset</figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Daniel Cooper for Engadget</div></figure><p>Neurable believes that its systems, which are designed to integrate with any manufacturer’s gear, has the potential to dramatically increase a person’s brain health and productivity. For instance, by taking a break when a person’s focus started to wane, they were able to bounce back and function for far longer than if they’d simply pushed harder. Similarly, the company can advise on your cognitive speed and brain age and guide you toward making healthy choices. The company says that this isn’t just about wellness, either, as being able to identify loss of focus is vital, for instance, to help reduce auto accidents when truck drivers feel fatigued.&nbsp;</p><p>Co-founder Adam Molnar explained that the benefits of this technology compound over time, so the more practice a user has in finding that mental state of calm focus, the easier it will be to maintain it for longer. CEO Ramses Alcaide added the company’s aim is to enable people to visualize the often invisible symptoms of cognitive stress to ensure they’re looking after themselves. He added that one thing that separates Neurable from other companies is that it’s looking at far finer-grain detail from its EEG data.&nbsp;</p><figure><img src=\"https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/eeg-mywaves.jpg\" data-crop-orig-src=\"https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/eeg-mywaves.jpg\" style=\"height:1013px;width:1800px;\" alt=\"MyWaves\" data-uuid=\"6a5c70c7-2b45-4ad2-ab44-94cadc3beb6f\"/><figcaption>MyWaves</figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Daniel Cooper for Engadget</div></figure><p>There are plenty of companies at CES that are using EEGs for more specific goals, such as <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"link\" href=\"https://mywaves.tech/\" data-i13n=\"cpos:7;pos:1\">MyWaves</a>. It uses an EEG as part of its broader offering to use sound patterns to make it easier to go to sleep. It sells you a pricey forehead-worn EEG which you wear for a few nights over the course of a year. From there, the system produces a half hour audio file that will mirror the pattern of your delta brainwaves. It claims that, if you listen to the track before you go to bed, the experience of hearing your delta waves will help you fall asleep faster and experience more REM sleep.</p><p>And there are plenty of companies which are building EEGs for you to wear to keep an eye on your mental health. Brain-Life, for instance, showed off an early prototype of Focus+, a headband EEG with a companion app that can offer feedback on your cognitive load. It can also tell you how long you can sustain your attention and how well your mind relaxes and recovers. The company didn’t have details on when the hardware would be available or how much it cost, as it’s still early days.</p><figure><img src=\"https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/eeg-braineulink.jpg\" data-crop-orig-src=\"https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/eeg-braineulink.jpg\" style=\"height:1013px;width:1800px;\" alt=\"BrainEULink.\" data-uuid=\"e4c2dc73-4c20-444b-a63b-57fe79c0cfac\"/><figcaption>BrainEULink.</figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Daniel Cooper for Engadget</div></figure><p>There is broad potential to use an EEG as a brain computer interface, such as the one worked on by Braineulink. That company has combined an EEG with an AR headset to enable people to interact with the world just with their brains. For instance, in a demonstration in the show floor at CES, I was able to turn a light on and off by “focusing” on it, although it’s hard to know how useful that would be in, for instance, creating an assistive device for folks with limited mobility. Like Brain-Life, it’s early days, and so there’s no product that we can point to, but it’s clear we’re going to see more startups looking to enter this world.&nbsp;</p><figure><img src=\"https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/eeg-brainlife.jpg\" data-crop-orig-src=\"https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/eeg-brainlife.jpg\" style=\"height:1013px;width:1800px;\" alt=\"Brain-Life\" data-uuid=\"8e00a0f7-f339-4ff2-b4f3-d7715ddd928b\"/><figcaption>Brain-Life</figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Daniel Cooper for Engadget</div></figure><p>As EEGs become more commonplace, it’s likely they’ll be packaged in smaller devices which fit more seamlessly into our lives. One such example is NAOX, a French startup which has built a wearable, clinical-grade EEG into a pair of earbuds for the sort of longitudinal testing required to diagnose conditions like epilepsy. But the company is also planning on incorporating the technology into a pair of true wireless earbuds.These headphones won’t be arriving until the end of 2026, but Naox says the tech is small enough that it can be integrated with other companies earbuds. Consequently, it’s certainly plausible we could see plenty of earbuds that will keep an eye on our brain health as a side hustle.&nbsp;</p><figure><img src=\"https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/eeg-naoxclinical.jpg\" data-crop-orig-src=\"https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/eeg-naoxclinical.jpg\" style=\"height:1013px;width:1800px;\" alt=\"Naox\" data-uuid=\"09b9102c-62ab-4c72-8f85-cd0bfd2d0408\"/><figcaption>Naox</figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Daniel Cooper for Engadget</div></figure><p>NAOX was co-founded by Dr. Michel Le Van Quyen who, <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKhpC2qijQA\" data-i13n=\"cpos:8;pos:1\">at a talk in London in December 2025</a>, talked about the rationale for creating an in-ear ECG. Essentially, he was looking to build a brain equivalent to the Apple Watch’s continuous heart rate monitoring (and ECG). I was curious about the science behind an ear-mounted EEG given they commonly use the scalp. Professor Friston said that an ear-mounted EEG is potentially more useful as “you can get slightly closer to the sources of activity.” And that it makes a lot of sense for a consumer-grade EEG to be added to wireless earbuds given their utility in practices like meditation.</p><figure><img src=\"https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/eeg-naoxtws.jpg\" data-crop-orig-src=\"https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/eeg-naoxtws.jpg\" style=\"height:1013px;width:1800px;\" alt=\"Naox&#39;s prototype TWS earbuds sensors.\" data-uuid=\"57ea4c48-a263-4b21-a655-64e6ccbeafcd\"/><figcaption>Naox&#39;s prototype TWS earbuds sensors.</figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Daniel Cooper for Engadget</div></figure><p>One downside of the proliferation of wearable EEGs is that it could lead users to jump to the wrong conclusions about their mental health. For instance, if someone is to be diagnosed with a condition such as epilepsy, they need to undergo a 24-hour perambulatory EEG. As Professor Friston explained, the recording of that 24 hour EEG would be “carefully scrutinized by experts who are able to run a differential diagnosis ... to specify what further investigations are required.” He, like a lot of clinicians, is concerned about ill-informed consumers using these devices to make medical interventions without consulting a professional.&nbsp;</p><p>Friston added that people shouldn’t expect wearable EEGs to be magic bullets for their brain health or cognition. He said the best way for a consumer to approach them is by treating them with the same level of reverence as a household thermometer. “Are thermometers useful in managing the wellness of my children?, Yes,” he explained, “can your thermometer tell you what particular virus you have? Absolutely not.” “In the context of well-being and to augment or validate practices such as mindfulness and meditation, they can be fun and useful quantitative devices.” But, fundamentally, that is all he feels they can be, especially right now.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/wearables/the-ces-companies-hoping-your-brain-is-the-next-big-thing-in-computing-175048601.html?src=rss",

For parents of small children who are constantly leaving their toys around, it would be pretty convenient to have a tiny robot picking up after them. Also for me, who doesn&#39;t have children but a very sweet and hardworking cat who loves to steal socks and then deliver them as if they&#39;re her kills, leaving socks scattered all over the house.

Like a lot of AI companion devices we saw at CES, it’s  equipped with a small camera and microphone that enables it to constantly interact with you. The camera also enables its “memory” so the pet can recognize and deliver personalized updates to its person.

    "body": "<p>Chances are that you&#39;re here because you&#39;ve heard a virtual private network (VPN) can change your virtual location, and want to know what that means.

But if you&#39;re clueless, read on.</p><p>Whenever any device connects to the internet — whether it&#39;s a laptop, a phone or a <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/lego-unveils-a-technology-packed-smart-brick-at-ces-2026-190000511.html\" data-i13n=\"cpos:2;pos:1\">smart Lego brick</a> — it&#39;s assigned a unique IP address that other devices can use to identify it. Think of the name you give the barista at a coffee shop, except instead of a hot beverage, you’re being served websites and digital audio and video.</p><p>That&#39;s the upside. The downside is that a device&#39;s IP address can be used to find its location in the real world. That means service providers can show you local weather reports — as well as targeted local ads. More ominously, however, it means service providers can restrict what you see online based on where you are physically. That impacts everything from the fun (what Netflix has available to stream) to the serious (what information gets censored on the government&#39;s behalf).</p><p><a target=\"_blank\" class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/what-is-a-vpn-and-what-can-you-do-with-one-161549146.html\" data-i13n=\"cpos:3;pos:1\">A VPN gets around that downside</a> by running all your online activity through a middleman server before sending it to its destination. Instead of your real IP address, everyone sees the address of the VPN server, along with its geolocation. That means you can subvert any local restrictions getting in your way: You’re actually in Houston, but so far as the website you’re viewing is concerned, you seem to be coming from Amsterdam. Here&#39;s how to do it.</p><h2 id=\"jump-link-how-to-change-your-virtual-location-with-a-vpn\"><strong>How to change your virtual location with a VPN</strong></h2><p>With so many excellent commercial VPNs on the market, changing your virtual location is a lot easier than it sounds. You don&#39;t need to be a hacker — just find a good VPN app and connect to a server in your desired location. On almost any VPN, this is a simple matter of opening the app or desktop client and choosing the server location from a list.</p><figure><img src=\"https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/Proton_VPN_Mac_interface.png\" data-crop-orig-src=\"https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/Proton_VPN_Mac_interface.png\" style=\"height:1872px;width:3407px;\" alt=\"On Proton VPN, for example, you can switch locations by clicking the name of any country in the list on the left.\" data-uuid=\"c0ecfb77-d3b2-4d75-b95e-1db966e6c94e\"/><figcaption>On Proton VPN, for example, you can switch locations by clicking the name of any country in the list on the left.</figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Sam Chapman for Engadget</div></figure><p>However, as with any technology, there are some potential pitfalls. For reference, I&#39;ve laid out the steps below for both desktop and mobile devices.</p><h3 id=\"jump-link-how-to-change-location-on-windows-or-mac\"><strong>How to change location on Windows or Mac</strong></h3><p>Use these steps to change the virtual location of any desktop or laptop device running macOS or Windows. There may be slight variations, but in general, this process works for any top VPN.</p><ol><li><p>Select a VPN provider. You can rely on Engadget&#39;s best VPN list or, if you&#39;re unable to pay for a new subscription right now, our list of the <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/best-free-vpn-120032818.html\" data-i13n=\"cpos:4;pos:1\">best free VPNs</a>. My personal choice is <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/proton-vpn-review-2025-a-nonprofit-service-with-premium-performance-153046073.html\" data-i13n=\"cpos:5;pos:1\">Proton VPN</a>, but there are other good options. Look for a service with fast speeds, modern encryption and a long, non-controversial record in the industry.</p></li><li><p>Create an account with the VPN and save your username and password. Unless it&#39;s a forever-free service, this is when you&#39;ll be asked to pay for a subscription. If you&#39;re sure about your provider, you can save a lot by going with a long-term deal. See our list of the <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/deals/the-best-vpn-deals-up-to-88-percent-off-protonvpn-surfshark-expressvpn-nordvpn-and-more-120056445.html\" data-i13n=\"cpos:6;pos:1\">best VPN deals</a> for ideas.</p></li><li><p>Download the VPN app. It&#39;s best to go through the VPN&#39;s website, even if you&#39;re on Mac — in rare cases, the App Store versions can be outdated or short on features. Look for a download center on the site, and make sure you enter it while logged in.</p></li><li><p>Install the VPN app. Most VPNs have an installation flow built in, so all you have to do is follow the steps. If the VPN asks you to change your settings or grant it permissions, do it; this installs the tools it needs to do its job.</p></li><li><p>Open the VPN app and find your way around the user interface. At a minimum, make sure you know how to connect, disconnect and open the location selection menu.</p></li><li><p>Connect to a server in the location where you want your internet connection to appear to originate. If you&#39;re trying to get around local restrictions, you can just pick any nearby country without that censorship — for example, if you&#39;re in China, then Japan, South Korea or Singapore will work. If you&#39;re after content from a specific country, choose a server in that country.</p></li><li><p>Get online through a browser or connected app as you normally would. To make sure your location has actually changed, use a site like <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"link\" href=\"https://whatismyipaddress.com/\" data-i13n=\"cpos:7;pos:1\">WhatIsMyIPAddress</a> to check where you&#39;re coming from.</p></li><li><p>When you want to use your real location again, disconnect from the VPN or choose a server in the county you&#39;re in.</p></li></ol><p>It&#39;s not necessary, but I also recommend activating your VPN&#39;s kill switch if there is one. VPN servers aren&#39;t perfect, and they do drop connections from time to time. If this happens, an active kill switch also cuts off your internet connection so your real location isn&#39;t visible for a millisecond.</p><h3 id=\"jump-link-how-to-change-location-on-iphone-or-android\"><strong>How to change location on iPhone or Android</strong></h3><p>The process for using a VPN to change your virtual location on mobile is pretty similar to how it&#39;s done on desktop. Again, while individual installation flows have their own quirks, the following steps are broadly applicable to any iOS or Android VPN.</p><ol><li><p>Pick a VPN provider you like. The best VPNs also tend to be the best for mobile, including Proton VPN, <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/vpn-review-expressvpn-2023-gaming-streaming-160052492.html\" data-i13n=\"cpos:8;pos:1\">ExpressVPN</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/surfshark-vpn-review-a-fast-vpn-for-casual-users-170022675.html\" data-i13n=\"cpos:9;pos:1\">Surfshark</a>. On mobile, you can use app store reviews and comments to research. Make sure you&#39;re getting the real version of your chosen VPN and not a similarly named one trying to piggyback.</p></li><li><p>Download the VPN from the Apple App Store or Google Play Store. At this point, if you haven&#39;t paid yet, you may be able to take advantage of a free trial by opening the app and proceeding through the setup flow. This is a good time to test if the VPN is changing your location in ways that can&#39;t be seen through.</p></li><li><p>Follow the VPN&#39;s instructions to create an account, including paying for a subscription if necessary.</p></li><li><p>Take some time to learn to use the VPN app. Mobile interfaces have to pack more features into a smaller space, usually relying on tabs. Try and find the tabs for picking server locations and toggling VPN settings.</p></li><li><p>Connect to a server in your desired location. Make sure the VPN is actually active before you proceed (most of them make it pretty clear, but it&#39;s still easy to forget).</p></li><li><p>Get online through a browser or another internet-capable app.</p></li><li><p>When you&#39;re finished, disconnect from the VPN to return to using your real location.</p></li></ol><p>One more note: on both mobile and desktop, I recommend using either a paid VPN or a free VPN supported by a paid subscription. Entirely free VPNs <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/vpns-are-booming-in-the-uk-after-age-restriction-laws-but-free-options-carry-big-risks-060036636.html\" data-i13n=\"cpos:10;pos:1\">come with risks</a>, and some popular apps <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/researchers-find-alarming-overlaps-among-18-popular-vpns-191828342.html\" data-i13n=\"cpos:11;pos:1\">secretly share problematic connections</a>.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=\"jump-link-why-change-your-virtual-location\"><strong>Why change your virtual location?</strong></h2><p>Changing your virtual location isn&#39;t hard, but it&#39;s still an extra step between you and the internet. However, the benefits of location masking far outweigh the small amount of extra work. Hiding your IP address — and your location along with it — is one of the most impactful <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/12-steps-you-can-take-right-now-to-be-safer-online-130008335.html\" data-i13n=\"cpos:12;pos:1\">steps you can take to stay safe online</a>.</p><p>Concealing your IP address has massive benefits on its own, even if you use one close to your real location (which gets you shorter loading times). Lots of web services track you without your consent, frequently for advertising purposes. Some of this is done through third-party cookies, but a lot of it starts with building profiles about your IP address.</p><p>Illicit actors can also take advantage of your IP address and its geolocation. A hacker can track you down to within your ZIP code — though an IP address can&#39;t pinpoint your location to the square foot, it makes it much easier to narrow down where you live.

For one thing, when traveling abroad, you might want to use a site only available in your home country. Simply connect to a server located near home and you can use your bank account and local streaming libraries as normal.</p><p>If you&#39;re home, there are lots of benefits to being virtually in another region. You can see a foreign country&#39;s streaming libraries and shop for deals that may only be available in its currency. You can also get around any nationwide online censorship and potentially download banned apps. Just be sure to be aware of your local laws to know if doing so is merely frowned upon, or if it’s truly against the law.</p><h2 id=\"jump-link-can-a-vpn-change-your-gps-location\"><strong>Can a VPN change your GPS location?</strong></h2><p>There&#39;s one more critical point to remember when changing location with a VPN. The VPN server only changes your IP address and the physical location associated with it. It does not change the GPS location your device might be broadcasting.</p><p>GPS data can leak out in a few ways. Tablets and phones have location services turned on by default, and as anyone who&#39;s heard a true crime podcast knows, they can also give away your location by contacting cell towers. Web browsers often have similar features. Websites can also use HTML5 geolocation to access your GPS — provided you give permission, but that&#39;s easy to do without thinking.</p><p>Some VPNs, including Surfshark and Windscribe, do have features designed to fool GPS, but they&#39;re not standard. When you&#39;re changing your location with a VPN, make sure to turn off location services and avoid granting any permissions that might reveal where you really are. You can also run a separate GPS spoofing app alongside your VPN.</p><h2 id=\"jump-link-how-to-troubleshoot-a-vpn-thats-not-changing-your-location\"><strong>How to troubleshoot a VPN that&#39;s not changing your location</strong></h2><p>If you&#39;ve found that browsers are still seeing your old IP address while you have a VPN active, or that websites show you the same content when you&#39;re supposed to be virtually abroad, there&#39;s a chance your VPN isn&#39;t actually changing your location. To test if your real position is leaking, start by checking your IP address (with a search engine or WhatIsMyIPAddress). If it matches your home location, something has gone wrong.</p><p>Note that it&#39;s not necessarily a problem if it doesn&#39;t match your home location or the stated location of your VPN server. VPNs use virtual server locations to reach a lot of locations where brick-and-mortar servers aren&#39;t practical — Windscribe, for example, does not have a physical data center in Antarctica.</p><p>If you find that your VPN is leaking your real IP address, try these troubleshooting steps in order. I&#39;ve arranged them roughly from least to most time-intensive.</p><ol><li><p>Disconnect from your VPN and reconnect to the same location. This should hook you up with a different server in that same place. Test your IP again — there&#39;s a good chance the problem was isolated to the first server you tried.</p></li><li><p>Try a new location (skip this step if you need a server in a particular country).</p></li><li><p>Try a different VPN protocol. If you&#39;re using WireGuard, switch to OpenVPN or IKEv2.</p></li><li><p>Make sure location services are turned off.</p></li><li><p>Clear your browser cache and cookies to get rid of any saved information.</p></li><li><p>Test for DNS leaks. Your VPN might accidentally be sending your IP address to a public server to resolve DNS requests. <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"link\" href=\"http://IPleak.org\" data-i13n=\"cpos:14;pos:1\"><a target=\"_blank\" class=\"link\">IPleak.org</a></a> is a good tool for catching this.</p></li><li><p>Try a different VPN. Use a free service like Proton or Windscribe and test for leaks. If the problem reoccurs, it might be coming from inside your network.</p></li><li><p>Contact the helpdesk for your original VPN and inform them about the problem. Get screenshots of the VPN connected to the leaky location next to IP address data confirming the leak.</p></li></ol><p>I&#39;ve already mentioned several VPNs that do a good job of changing your location, but in case you&#39;re here for product advice, here are all my recommendations in one place. My favorite VPN is <strong>Proton VPN,</strong> which is so far the only service to receive full marks on my location-change test. I used 15 of its servers in five different countries to access Netflix. Each time, I saw the destination country&#39;s full content library like I was really there.</p><p><strong>Surfshark </strong>is a close runner-up in this category. It passed 14 out of 15 tests, only slipping up once in Japan — and a quick disconnect and reconnect was enough to fix that. I got equally great results from <strong>ExpressVPN</strong>, only having to retry one server in the UK. <strong>NordVPN </strong>performed perfectly in every location except Nigeria, and that still didn&#39;t leak my real IP address. The problem only seemed to exist on Netflix.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/how-to-change-location-with-a-vpn-140000339.html?src=rss",

This is the first time in its history that the space agency is cutting a mission short due to a medical issue, but it didn’t identify the crew member or divulge the exact situation and its severity. The agency is targeting a return date no earlier than January 14, with the exact schedule depending on the weather.

NASA’s chief health and medical officer, James “JD” Polk, said the affected astronaut is “absolutely stable” and that this isn’t a case of an emergency evacuation. The ISS has a “robust suite of medical hardware” onboard, he said, but not enough for a complete workup to determine a diagnosis. Without a proper diagnosis, NASA doesn’t know if the astronaut’s health could be negatively affected by the environment aboard the ISS. That is why the agency is erring on the side of caution. </p><p>Crew-11 left for the space station on August 1 and was supposed to come back to Earth on or around February 20. After they leave the station, only three people will remain: Two cosmonauts and one astronauts who’ll be in charge of all the experiments currently being conducted on the orbiting lab. The team’s replacement, Crew-12, was supposed to head to the ISS mid-February, but NASA is considering sending the astronauts to the station earlier than that. </p><p><strong>Update, January 10, 2025, 5:15AM ET: </strong>This story has been updated to include Crew-11’s tentative return date.</p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/science/space/nasa-is-ending-crew-11-astronauts-mission-a-month-early-140000750.html?src=rss",

The week began with press conferences from huge companies at the show, mostly filled with AI buzzwords, vague promises and quite little in the way of hard news.</p><p>More than one company even decided to forgo announcing things during their conferences to make way for more AI chatter, only to publish press releases later quietly admitting that, yes, actually, they did make some consumer technology. It&#39;s appropriate, I guess, that as we&#39;re beginning to feel the knock-on cost effects of the AI industry&#39;s insatiable appetite for compute resources — higher utility bills and device prices — companies would rather use their flashy conferences to reinforce AI&#39;s supposedly must-have attributes rather than actually inform the public about their new products.</p><p>We&#39;re by no means AI luddites at Engadget, but it&#39;s fair to say that our team is more excited by tangible products that enrich our lives than iterative improvements to large language models.

It&#39;s portable, has a decent range of about 15 miles — with the option to swap out its battery on the go — and could give wheelchair users greater access to areas that would otherwise be difficult to move about in. It can also keep the wheelchair from speeding up when a person is traveling on a downward slope.</p><p>This feels very much like a product that will actually see the light of day, and could be genuinely helpful.

The system is designed to take standard Lego sets and make them more interactive thanks to a tech-packed Smart Brick. Those bricks have a tiny chip the size of a Lego stud that enables things like motion, color and proximity sensing. They also have a tiny speaker that further helps bring Lego builds to life.&nbsp;</p><p>The Smart Brick is mostly a blank slate, but pairing it with Lego&#39;s Smart Tags and Smart Minifigures is what enables these new play scenarios. Unsurprisingly, Lego introduced the Smart Play system alongside Star Wars sets that make these new immersive elements more obvious. An X-Wing piloted by Luke Skywalker can get into a dogfight with Darth Vader&#39;s TIE fighter, and you&#39;ll hear the engines roar to life, the characters exclaim as they come under fire and the spaceship explodes if it gets hit too many times. And Smart Play requires no setup, meaning that the technology packed into the Smart Brick fades away and lets kids (and kids at heart) get down to the business of playing. You don&#39;t need to know how it works — it just does. — <em>Nathan Ingraham, Deputy editor</em></p><h2 id=\"jump-link-best-pc-or-laptop-dell-xps-14--16\">Best PC or laptop: Dell XPS 14 + 16</h2><figure><img src=\"https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/bestof_xps.jpg\" data-crop-orig-src=\"https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/bestof_xps.jpg\" style=\"height:720px;width:1280px;\" alt=\"The Dell XPS 14 and 16.\" data-uuid=\"3837f0f2-cec8-4cc5-82b3-c8558352b1ee\" data-display-size=\"standard\"><figcaption>The Dell XPS 14 and 16.</figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Dell</div></figure><p>In a way, this award is for Dell’s latest flagship laptops but also the company itself.

Dell also streamlined its designs with the larger XPS 16 dropping an entire pound compared to the previous generation. The company even addressed a number of our previous critiques by switching from capacitive touch controls back to a classic row of function keys and reverting to segmented touchpads instead of seamless glass ones that made it hard to keep track of your cursor.&nbsp;</p><p>But perhaps the best part is that Dell isn’t stopping here, because the company also teased a new version of its legendary XPS 13 slated for later this year, the thinnest and lightest member of the family yet.

Furthermore, ASUS included not one but two brilliant OLED panels with up to 1,100 nits of brightness and color accuracy so good you won’t have a problem editing photos or videos.

IXI’s glasses feature an elegant, unique, cameraless eye-tracking system that uses ultra-low-power LEDs and photodiodes to precisely monitor the user&#39;s eye movement and focus convergence. This data drives a liquid crystal lens layer, enabling a focus switch between near and far distances in approximately 0.2 seconds.&nbsp;Focus your gaze elsewhere, and your glasses return to their normal prescription.&nbsp;Think of them as a high-tech take on the often thick and clunky multifocal lenses we’re currently stuck with.</p><p>IXI is now finalizing the production process, developing manufacturing and gaining the necessary medical certification to sell its glasses, but it has already struck deals with lens manufacturers in Europe.

They’re packed with modern technology, so they can respond to how you play with them or the sets you build. The Smart Brick has a 4.1mm ASIC chip, which Lego says is smaller than a standard Lego stud. It senses things like motion, orientation and magnetic fields, but also has a tiny built-in speaker, which produces audio “tied to live play actions,” not just canned clips.</p>\n<p>It’s hard to explain it in only a few words (we’ve got a deep-dive hands-on <a data-i13n=\"cpos:2;pos:1\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/lego-smart-play-hands-on-using-smart-brick-technology-to-get-kids-to-play-together-133000740.html\"><ins>right here</ins></a>), but what immediately drew me in was the lack of smartphone pairing and screens. The ability of each part to detect and interact with others can lead to some ridiculous setups, whether it’s ducks and police officers or a helicopter or an X-Wing.</p>\n<p>Naturally, it’s a little pricier than basic Lego, but not out of the realm of being a special gift or birthday present. One of the first sets, with a smart Darth Vader Minifigure, one Smart Brick and one Smart Tag, is $70.</p>\n<p>We&#39;ll be back to our regularly scheduled newsletter next week.

But if you went looking for sustainability products, you’re going to have to hunt a bit. </p><p>Last year, the Sustainability section at the Las Vegas Convention Center had 20 booths. This year, there were 38, but that’s in part due to the combination of the energy and sustainability categories. So exhibitors like South Korea’s largest electric utility company, a nuclear power company from the same country and lots of battery manufacturers. There was also an AI data platform booth in the section that had nothing to do with sustainability as far as I can tell. Guess the organizers just ran out of room for all the AI. </p><p>Within the sustainability section, and at other CES venues, I found a few encouraging displays of sustainable products — organizations and devices that were trying to address the <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/the-us-withdraws-from-dozens-of-international-bodies-including-climate-focused-organizations-195259578.html\" data-i13n=\"cpos:5;pos:1\">multitude of problems</a> the world is facing when it comes to energy production, climate and pollution. </p><p>But none of it quite achieved Engadget’s <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/engadgets-best-of-ces-2026-all-the-new-tech-that-caught-our-eye-in-las-vegas-200057123.html\" data-i13n=\"cpos:6;pos:1\">best of CES</a> status this year. Some of what we saw was utility-scale, some wasn’t quite ready for consumer consumption and other stuff was too niche or had too many caveats to make the list. I won’t go so far as to say sustainability is dead at CES, because that sends me into dark downward spirals, but it’s getting sparse out there, friends. </p><p>Here are the companies I saw that had promise and innovative ideas.

So every time someone washes their hands or flushes a toilet in a building, the roof-top system generates a bit of power. CoolVigor uses the same principles to harness energy from HVAC systems.

You can use the power directly, tie it into your home system, feed it into the grid or hook it up to one of Jackery’s many power stations to save the power for later.

    "body": "<p>Clicks is an apologetically gadgety company, making gear that <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/clicks-hands-on-a-charming-keyboard-for-2024-thats-relying-on-more-than-just-nostalgia-131537619.html\" data-i13n=\"cpos:1;pos:1\">feels charmingly out-of-place</a> in a world where almost every smartphone out there is an all-screen slab.

And while there isn’t a working prototype of the Clicks Communicator available for the press to see, I got to check out the new Power Keyboard talk with Clicks co-founder and former BlackBerry marketing director Jeff Gadway about where he thinks his products fit into the smartphone world.</p><p>At first glance, the $79 Power Keyboard feels like a big improvement over the original Clicks Keyboard case. It magnetically attaches to any phone with Qi2 and connects over Bluetooth. The keyboard itself is similar to the original Clicks keyboard, but there’s a dedicated number row which is a nice improvement. But the thing that really caught my eye was its old-school slider form factor. When closed, the Power Keyboard sits on the back of your phone like a thick wireless battery pack — but it satisfyingly slides up to reveal the keyboard like the Palm Pre or BlackBerry Torch smartphones of old. </p><figure><img src=\"https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/DSCF9191.jpg\" data-crop-orig-src=\"https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/DSCF9191.jpg\" style=\"height:1350px;width:2400px;\" alt=\"The magnetic, sliding Clicks Power Keyboard.\" data-uuid=\"0ce88f11-8353-414f-af2a-31e90ceac187\"><figcaption>The magnetic, sliding Clicks Power Keyboard.</figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Nathan Ingraham for Engadget</div></figure><p>The Power Keyboard’s last trick is that it can charge your phone up when attached. The battery itself isn’t huge, so you’re not going to fully recharge a modern smartphone. But it’s still a nice addition for if you need some power in a pinch. You can also set it up so it doesn’t charge your phone and instead uses all the battery to power the keyboard; in that situation, the keyboard will last weeks without a charge. Or you can designate a percentage that can only be used by the keyboard — for example, if the battery pack’s charge drops below 20 percent, it’ll stop charging your phone and instead save that power for the keyboard.</p><figure><img src=\"https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/DSCF9209.jpg\" data-crop-orig-src=\"https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/DSCF9209.jpg\" style=\"height:1350px;width:2400px;\" alt=\"The Clicks Power Keyboard, without a phone attached.\" data-uuid=\"d7e2775d-42b4-4516-ab1c-fc8d809e1e93\"><figcaption>The Clicks Power Keyboard, without a phone attached.</figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Nathan Ingraham for Engadget</div></figure><p>As someone who has never owned a smartphone with a keyboard, I can’t say how good the Clicks keyboard actually is — there would be a definite learning curve before I got comfortable with it. It certainly feels tiny to me, but if you just type on and trust autocorrect you should get the hang of it before too long. Whether the benefits of using a physical keyboard matter are up to you to decide. It’s nice seeing a bigger screen unobstructed by the virtual keyboard, but I feel far too set in my touchscreen ways to consider switching it up. But some people just loved their keyboards, and for them this gadget might hit the spot.</p><p>The Clicks Communicator is the more unexpected of the two new devices the comapny is working on, but without a working demo model I can’t render any judgement about how it will actually work. When it was announced, Clicks specifically said they were targeting people who used multiple devices, a demographic that I wasn’t fully convinced was large enough to justify the Communicator’s existence. But Gadway assured me the company had done plenty of research before moving into the hardware production phase. </p><p>“You&#39;ve got people who are mandated to carry a second device for corporate deploy. Then you&#39;ve got people who are small business owners and want to have a separate phone for their small business,” he said. “In markets like Europe, there&#39;s a requirement for employers to give people the option to have a separate device and create more separation. You&#39;ve got travelers who want a second SIM, and then you&#39;ve got this growing cohort of digital detox, digital minimalism, digital well-being people.” None of those segments might be huge on its own, but add it all up and the Clicks team felt like they had a decent opportunity. </p><figure><img src=\"https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/DSCF9236.jpg\" data-crop-orig-src=\"https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/DSCF9236.jpg\" style=\"height:1350px;width:2400px;\" alt=\"The Clicks Communicator has an LED Light on its side button that you can customize for different notifications.\" data-uuid=\"383d6067-92af-4f84-ac04-08018df735a3\"><figcaption>The Clicks Communicator has an LED Light on its side button that you can customize for different notifications.</figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Nathan Ingraham for Engadget</div></figure><p>The other half of the thought process was making the Communicator different from an iPhone or Pixel — instead of having two essentially identical devices, Clicks wanted to make the Communicator with a distinct focus. “Our thought process was that complementary devices in tech are on the rise,’ Gadway said. “You wear an Oura Ring and you wear a smart watch; you carry an e-reader for reading and a tablet for content consumption. So why shouldn&#39;t your second phone be better at certain things than your first phone instead of just being a straight duplicate?”</p><p>That’s where the squarish, 4-inch touchscreen, keyboard and custom implementation of <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"link rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=b747fd19-ae32-4fad-ae62-84f9d8942106&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;linkText=the+Niagara+Android+launcher&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3BsYXkuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS9zdG9yZS9hcHBzL2RldGFpbHM_aWQ9Yml0cGl0LmxhdW5jaGVyJmhsPWVuX1VTIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJiNzQ3ZmQxOS1hZTMyLTRmYWQtYWU2Mi04NGY5ZDg5NDIxMDYiLCJvcmlnaW5hbFVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vcGxheS5nb29nbGUuY29tL3N0b3JlL2FwcHMvZGV0YWlscz9pZD1iaXRwaXQubGF1bmNoZXImaGw9ZW5fVVMifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAVzMyKyse3TDKidO_Oy2Ej2eR8LRmly8IFYzm1Y2whhd&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fplay.google.com%2Fstore%2Fapps%2Fdetails%3Fid%3Dbitpit.launcher%26hl%3Den_US\" data-i13n=\"elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:;cpos:3;pos:1\" data-original-link=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=bitpit.launcher&amp;hl=en_US\">the Niagara Android launcher</a>, which is a list-based UI rather than a grid of apps. The custom Clicks implementation of it focuses on your messaging apps and quickly triaging through new items (hence the Communicator name). The keyboard itself is touch sensitive and can be swiped across to navigate and take actions on what you see. But the Communicator is just an Android phone at heart which means you can install any apps that you find essential — though its form factor changes what it is best used for. “You can download whatever apps you want, but we&#39;ve optimized it to be better at specific things,” Gadway said. “So, you know, do you want to watch letterboxed TikTok videos on this? Probably not. You could, but it&#39;s not the thing you&#39;re going to reach for to do that. But we&#39;re not going to give you a product that restricts what you can do.”</p><p>The good thing about being a smaller hardware maker is that Clicks doesn’t need to sell millions of these — they’re just interested in offering an alternative for people who might enjoy it, just as they’ve done with their keyboard accessories. Of course, the Communicator is a bigger investment; it’s up for pre-order now for $399 (that’s Pixel 9a territory, for comparison). Once it launches in the second half of the year, we’ll find out if it can find its audience. </p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/the-clicks-co-founder-explains-who-its-tiny-communicator-phone-is-for-170000501.html?src=rss",

These are the first chips built using Intel’s 18A (18 angstroms, which is just under 2nm) process.

There’s even a touch of LED underlighting on this model as well as on the $1,599 L/R M, which has 300W of power, smaller four-inch dual woofers and the same 28mm tweeter. All three speakers will be available later this year.</p><p>There’s lots more audio gear at CES beyond the Victrola and Cambridge Audio speakers, of course.

They’re the company’s first open-ear buds with ANC. You can snap them up in February for $180. There’s also a new portable Bluetooth speaker from Anker called the Soundcore Boom Go 3i. It’s a 15W unit with (according to Anker) up to 22 hours of battery life, and it should cost between $65 and $80 when it drops in March. </p><p>Engadget deputy editor Billy Steele has been checking out some of the audio gear at CES, including <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/ces-2026-shokz-new-earbuds-effectively-reduce-noise-while-keeping-your-ears-open-080000996.html\" data-i13n=\"cpos:116;pos:1\">Shokz’ $250 OpenFit Pro earbuds</a> — which have Dolby Atmos support — and <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/audio/hands-on-with-fender-audios-headphones-and-speakers-at-ces-2026-203104561.html\" data-i13n=\"cpos:117;pos:1\">Fender Audio’s headphones and speakers</a>. </p><p>Billy has also had some hands-on (or heads-on) time with Klipsch’s first new headphones in years.

It&#39;s one of several companies working on models that can climb stairs, but the Cyber X is a slightly terrifying one since it has large legs that look a bit like chainsaws. The teeth in these legs help provide traction so that the Cyber X can climb stairs that are almost 10 inches high. </p><p>While Dreame’s vacuum positions its legs horizontally to climb stairs with tank-style traction, Roborock’s Saros rover pushes itself upwards on extendable legs to reach higher floors. The legs have wheels on the bottom and knee-like joints — these can help the robot vacuum to raise itself over obstacles on floors too.</p><div><div style=\"left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;\"><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/jXSqguJ3J0c?rel=0\" style=\"top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;\" allowfullscreen scrolling=\"no\" data-provider-name=\"youtube\"></iframe></div></div><p><a target=\"_blank\" class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/home/smart-home/narwals-first-mattress-vacuum-heats-taps-uv-blasts-and-sucks-up-all-the-ick-living-in-your-bed-004929304.html\" data-i13n=\"cpos:120;pos:1\">Narwhal</a> built a new vacuum for your mattress.

The 1S has brighter, 1200p (up from 1080p) displays, a slightly wider field of view and a lower price — $449 instead of $499. There’s a new power bank/DisplayPort hub that you can use to recharge Xreal glasses and easily hook them up to a Nintendo Switch or Switch 2. The Xreal Neo is $99.

    "body": "<p><a target=\"_blank\" class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/home/lg-at-ces-2026-live-updates-from-the-companys-world-premiere-event-190159076.html\" data-i13n=\"cpos:1;pos:1\">LG opened CES 2026</a> by outlining its vision to reduce the physical effort and mental burden of life. Buy enough of the devices it’s presently working on and you’ll exist in an environment of “ambient care,” coddled by the machinery in your home. It sounds positively utopian: When the sensors in your bed know you’ve not slept well and are getting a cold, a <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/home/smart-home/lgs-cloid-robot-can-fold-laundry-and-serve-food-very-slowly-181902306.html\" data-i13n=\"cpos:2;pos:1\">robot</a> will wake you with a glass of freshly squeezed orange juice. When you’re in a rush to get to work, the robot will make you a sandwich for you to eat on the go, sparing you the effort of making it yourself. The more I roamed the halls of the show after that, the more I couldn’t help feeling uneasy about what so many companies here were pitching. To me, the vision of the future on show here is equal parts solitary and infantilized.</p><p>There’s obvious reasons for this: <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/ai/everything-nvidia-announced-at-ces-2026-225653684.html\" data-i13n=\"cpos:3;pos:1\">AI swallowed</a> the tech industry’s oxygen, sapping any chance of innovation in consumer hardware. The advent of <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/computing/ces-2026-intel-hopes-its-core-ultra-series-3-chips-are-the-start-of-a-comeback-000155611.html\" data-i13n=\"cpos:4;pos:1\">Panther Lake</a> is a win for Intel, but it’s not going to enable dramatic changes in how people work with their PCs on a daily basis. The US policy shift away <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/transportation/evs/a-shaky-year-for-american-evs-could-set-the-tone-for-2026-153000210.html\" data-i13n=\"cpos:5;pos:1\">from EVs</a> and toward fossil fuel-powered vehicles, too, means that the big names in auto manufacture have similarly shied away from the show. That left CES full of various robotics startups offering early visions of humanoid robots designed to work on <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/boston-dynamics-unveils-production-ready-version-of-atlas-robot-at-ces-2026-234047882.html\" data-i13n=\"cpos:6;pos:1\">production lines</a>, take care of your home and replace your pet. I saw more than a few stands where booth attendants were pretending to delight in <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.instagram.com/reel/DTRC3lOEg8j/?igsh=NTc4MTIwNjQ2YQ%3D%3D\" data-i13n=\"cpos:7;pos:1\">teaching their wheeled robot pets to play fetch</a>. At least, I <em>hope</em> they were pretending.</p><p>I’m painfully aware of how many devices felt like they were only a hop, skip and a jump away from the Sharper Image catalog. Gadgets that are designed to fill some perceived hole in your life that won’t actually make things better or easier in the long run. I’m leery about denigrating assistive technology that offers a vital lifeline to people with accessibility needs. I’m also leery about knocking devices that may enable people to keep working despite wrestling with long term injuries — I&#39;ve got one eye on the raft of exoskeletons exhibited at the show which might help me work in the garden despite the weakness in my lower back. But I’m also not quite sold on how many <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/home/smart-home/throne-from-the-co-founder-of-whoop-uses-computer-vision-to-study-your-poop-150000606.html\" data-i13n=\"cpos:8;pos:1\">toilet computers</a>, massage chairs and <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xu28o7TF8IE\" data-i13n=\"cpos:9;pos:1\">scootcases</a> we all need in our daily lives.&nbsp;</p><p>There’s also the elephant in the room that many of these innovations seem intent on acting as a replacement, substitute or supplement for real interaction. Robotic panda bears scuttling around your home to save you the effort of caring for a real flesh-and-blood pet. <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/gaming/pc/razer-put-a-waifu-in-a-bottle-at-ces-2026-205315908.html\" data-i13n=\"cpos:10;pos:1\">Holographic AI waifus</a> that will obsequiously respond to whatever you ask of it with nothing but flattery and agreement. The sheer volume of <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/ces-2026-live-updates-on-the-latest-gadgets-at-the-biggest-tech-event-of-the-year-153146311.html\" data-i13n=\"cpos:11;pos:1\">AI Labubus</a> operating as friend, enemy, companion or a combination of all the above. Cuddly home robots that are little more than a <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/home/smart-home/i-cant-get-over-this-goofy-long-necked-cyber-pet-robot-at-ces-175900062.html\" data-i13n=\"cpos:12;pos:1\">tablet on a moveable base</a> that’ll keep your kids entertained so you don’t have to. Yes, I’m being unfair, but sometimes shows like this make me sound like someone’s grandpa angrily insisting you darn kids get off your screens.&nbsp;</p><p>I feel some of these gadgets are specifically designed to enable a degree of detachment from our own bodies. We’re spending so much time getting dopamine from our devices that we’re no longer able to pay attention to how our bodies are feeling. In LG’s vision of the future, moving around for ourselves and making our own food is a thing of the past, which will, surely, put a dent in our physical and mental health. We lose the ability to connect with the people around us because we’ve spent too long being flattered by our AI lackeys. We need a machine to monitor the food we eat and the crap we excrete because we’re not willing to pay attention to what we’re doing. Much in the same way that AI encourages us to take shortcuts rather than enjoy the process of being creative, the rest of the tech industry seemingly wants us to shortcut the fundamentals of life.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ces-2026-offered-a-lonely-vision-of-the-future-160000993.html?src=rss",

In person, it navigated both up and down with surprising confidence, using its treads horizontally rather than actually stepping. The vacuum itself docks inside the climbing rig, so it’s more about getting your bot to the next floor than scrubbing the stairs, which still feels like a fair trade if you hate hauling appliances around.</p><h2 id=\"jump-link-ollobot\">OlloBot</h2><figure><img src=\"https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/olloheader.jpg\" data-crop-orig-src=\"https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/olloheader.jpg\" style=\"height:1080px;width:1920px;\" alt=\"Two OlloBots &#x002014; one with a long furry purple neck, making it about two feet taller than the other &#x002014; are pictured on a light purple floor, in front of a screen displaying a closeup of a child playing with blocks.\" data-uuid=\"7271ae67-acb9-4987-ae67-517ef063f68e\"><figcaption>Two OlloBots — one with a long furry purple neck, making it about two feet taller than the other — are pictured on a light purple floor, in front of a screen displaying a closeup of a child playing with blocks.</figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\"></div></figure><p>CES loves a companion robot, but <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/home/smart-home/i-cant-get-over-this-goofy-long-necked-cyber-pet-robot-at-ces-175900062.html\" data-i13n=\"slk:OlloBot;cpos:4;pos:1\">OlloBot</a> might be the first one we’ve met that’s part cyber pet, part penguin, part ET and somehow comes with a warm, furry, telescoping neck. Its “face” is basically a tablet for expressions, photos and messages, and it’s meant to evolve a personality over time based on how your household interacts with it. Bonus: its memories live in a removable heart-shaped module, so if the body breaks, you can (theoretically) transplant your robot’s soul into a new shell.</p><h2 id=\"jump-link-asus-rog-zephyrus-duo\">ASUS ROG Zephyrus Duo</h2><figure><img src=\"https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/zephyrus-duo-two-displays.jpg\" data-crop-orig-src=\"https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/zephyrus-duo-two-displays.jpg\" style=\"height:2000px;width:3333px;\" alt=\"On top of having two displays, the Zephyrus Duo&amp;#39;s screens also feature excellent brightness at up to 1,100 nits.\" data-uuid=\"3b80f798-cec6-305a-954f-3f36c7222243\"><figcaption>On top of having two displays, the Zephyrus Duo&amp;#39;s screens also feature excellent brightness at up to 1,100 nits.</figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\"></div></figure><p>Dual screens on a laptop aren’t new, but ASUS cramming two 16-inch OLED panels into a gaming notebook is the kind of chaotic CES energy we respect.

Its 16-inch display can physically expand sideways into ultra-wide formats, turning flight sims and racing games into full cockpit experiences at the press of a couple of keys. It’s impractical, faintly ridiculous and absolutely the kind of CES concept we hope survives long enough to escape the demo floor.</p><h2 id=\"jump-link-lenovo-thinkbook-xd-rollable\">Lenovo ThinkBook XD Rollable</h2><figure><img src=\"https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/XD-rollable-back.jpg\" data-crop-orig-src=\"https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/XD-rollable-back.jpg\" style=\"height:2000px;width:3333px;\" alt=\"With its XD Rollable concept, Lenovo took the Thinkbook Plus Gen 6&#39;s basic design and made it even more futuristic by allowing its flexible display to wrap around onto its lid.\" data-uuid=\"5ca5fe56-6894-4cd9-8f38-2fd1b5e0de40\"><figcaption>With its XD Rollable concept, Lenovo took the Thinkbook Plus Gen 6&#39;s basic design and made it even more futuristic by allowing its flexible display to wrap around onto its lid.</figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Sam Rutherford for Engadget</div></figure><p>If the Legion Pro Rollable is excessive, the <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/computing/laptops/lenovo-goes-sci-fi-with-its-wild-xd-rollable-concept-at-ces-2026-010000817.html\" data-i13n=\"cpos:11;pos:1\">ThinkBook XD Rollable</a> is philosophically confusing. Its flexible display doesn’t just grow taller, it wraps over the lid to create a “world-facing” screen for people sitting across from you, which feels either futuristic or deeply unnecessary depending on your mood and situation (maybe this is the perfect device for hotel check-ins and other points of sale?).

The upgraded sex toy model cranks battery life up to five hours and unlocks a Turbo mode so aggressive it was described as “overclocked,” which is not a term we expected to hear in this category. It can also charge your phone, because apparently even pleasure tech needs to justify itself with productivity.</p><h2 id=\"jump-link-ipolish\">iPolish</h2><figure><img src=\"https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/ipolishbody.jpg\" data-crop-orig-src=\"https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/ipolishbody.jpg\" style=\"height:1013px;width:1800px;\" alt=\"iPolish\" data-uuid=\"f59e675b-3650-499d-bfa3-e0806625ec0a\"><figcaption>iPolish</figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Daniel Cooper for Engadget</div></figure><p><a target=\"_blank\" class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/wearables/ipolish-brings-color-changing-press-on-smart-nails-to-ces-001345407.html\" data-i13n=\"cpos:13;pos:1\">iPolish</a> finally made <em>Total Recall</em> nail tech real, minus the dystopia and Schwarzenegger.

A camera in the crisper records what’s inside, while a built-in barcode scanner in the water dispenser can add items to your shopping list with a quick wave, no app fumbling required.
