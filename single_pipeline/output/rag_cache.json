    "title": "Simulating and understanding phase change | Guest video by Vilas Winstein",
    "body": "Deriving the Boltzmann formula, defining temperature, and simulating liquid/vapor.\n@SpectralCollective has the second part: https://youtu.be/yEcysu5xZH0\nYou can play with a simulation of this model here: https://vilas.us/simulations/liquidvapor/\nThese lessons are funded directly by viewers: https://3b1b.co/support\nHome page: https://www.3blue1brown.com\n\nNotes from Vilas:\n1) This open problem is to prove the ergodicity of the deterministic dynamical systems that are used to model the molecule-level physics. A good example of such a dynamical system is the box with particles evolving according to Newton's laws with elastic collisions, like in the video.\n\n2) This video assumes that all probability distributions are discrete, which is the case in the simulations. But one can also set up this formalism for systems with continuous state spaces. Again, a good example is particles in a box, which are not restricted to a lattice, which is only used for visualization purposes in this video.\n\n3) Strictly speaking, these \"derivatives\" don't make sense since in our simulations the energy can only take on a discrete set of values. But a derivative is the right way to think about this, and is the correct notion in a limiting sense.\n\n4) The factor of -T in the definition of the chemical potential is sort of a historical leftover, but including it has the convenient side effect of allowing the same Boltzmann formula to hold, with an energy function that depends on the chemical potential as well. It should also be noted that temperature must equalize in any situation where the chemical potential equalizes, since it is impossible for systems to exchange molecules without also exchanging energy.\n\n5) This algorithm, where we only choose one pixel at a time, is called Glauber dynamics. There are multiple ways to parallelize it, but the method chosen in this video is to only update each pixel with a low probability at each call of the compute shader, to avoid (frequently) updating two neighboring pixels simultaneously. One could also alternate between updating the even or odd pixels at each step.\n\n6) By \"zooming out,\" what is meant, technically, is a renormalization operation whereby each 3x3 grid of pixels is replaced by just one pixel, which has a molecule exactly when 5 or more of the pixels in the 3x3 grid have molecules. But that is somewhat tough to simulate as the size has to increase by 9 at each step, so this video cheats a bit by just zooming out on a large simulation.\n\n7) The \"interesting behavior\" referenced here is the fact that the interface between the up and down sections of the picture can be rescaled (as the size of the model goes to infinity) in a way that yields a universal random curve called Schramm-Loewner evolution. This family of random curves shows up in many seemingly-unrelated places in statistical mechanics and probability.\n\nChapter markers:\n0:00 - What is phase change?\n6:27 - The Boltzmann law and free energy\n12:05 - A preliminary simulation\n15:30 - Defining temperature\n21:25 - Deriving the Boltzmann law\n24:30 - Sampling with MCMC\n28:30 - Chemical potential\n33:20 - Interesting properties\n\nThis video made use of the following Creative Commons material:\n\nhttps://commons.m.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:How_to_(nearly)_instantly_freeze_a_bottle_of_sparkling_water.ogv\n\nhttps://commons.m.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Blue_rotating_brain_animation.mpg\n\nhttps://commons.m.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:7_Tesla_MRI_of_the_ex_vivo_human_brain_at_100_micron_resolution_(100_micron_MRI_acquired_FA25_coronal).webm\n\nhttps://commons.m.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Axonal_nerve_fibers_in_a_brain_-_the_neural_network_that_is_us.webm"

For this reason, we animated these vectors as orthogonal-ish. See: https://proceedings.mlr.press/v119/wang20k/wang20k.pdf\n\nPer Chenyang Yuan: at 10:15, the blurry image that results when removing random noise in DDPM is probably due to a mismatch in noise levels when calling the denoiser. When the denoiser is called on x_{t-1} during DDPM sampling, it is expected to have a certain noise level (let's call it sigma_{t-1}). If you generate x_{t-1} from x_t without adding noise, then the noise present in x_{t-1} is always smaller than sigma_{t-1}. This causes the denoiser to remove too much noise, thus pointing towards the mean of the dataset. \n\nThe text conditioning input to stable diffusion is not the 512-dim text embedding vector, but the output of the layer before that, [with dimension 77x512](https://stackoverflow.com/a/79243065)\n\nFor the vectors at 31:40 - Some implementations use f(x, t, cat) + alpha(f(x, t, cat) - f(x, t)), and some that do f(x, t) + alpha(f(x, t, cat) - f(x, t)), where an alpha value of 1 corresponds to no guidance. I chose the second format here to keep things simpler.\n\nAt 30:30, the unconditional t=1 vector field looks a bit different from what it did at the 17:15 mark. This is the result of different models trained for different parts of the video, and likely a result of different random initializations.\n\n\nPremium Beat Music ID: EEDYZ3FP44YX8OWT"

    "title": "Simulating and understanding phase change | Guest video by Vilas Winstein",
    "body": "Deriving the Boltzmann formula, defining temperature, and simulating liquid/vapor.\n@SpectralCollective has the second part: https://youtu.be/yEcysu5xZH0\nYou can play with a simulation of this model here: https://vilas.us/simulations/liquidvapor/\nThese lessons are funded directly by viewers: https://3b1b.co/support\nHome page: https://www.3blue1brown.com\n\nNotes from Vilas:\n1) This open problem is to prove the ergodicity of the deterministic dynamical systems that are used to model the molecule-level physics. A good example of such a dynamical system is the box with particles evolving according to Newton's laws with elastic collisions, like in the video.\n\n2) This video assumes that all probability distributions are discrete, which is the case in the simulations. But one can also set up this formalism for systems with continuous state spaces. Again, a good example is particles in a box, which are not restricted to a lattice, which is only used for visualization purposes in this video.\n\n3) Strictly speaking, these \"derivatives\" don't make sense since in our simulations the energy can only take on a discrete set of values. But a derivative is the right way to think about this, and is the correct notion in a limiting sense.\n\n4) The factor of -T in the definition of the chemical potential is sort of a historical leftover, but including it has the convenient side effect of allowing the same Boltzmann formula to hold, with an energy function that depends on the chemical potential as well. It should also be noted that temperature must equalize in any situation where the chemical potential equalizes, since it is impossible for systems to exchange molecules without also exchanging energy.\n\n5) This algorithm, where we only choose one pixel at a time, is called Glauber dynamics. There are multiple ways to parallelize it, but the method chosen in this video is to only update each pixel with a low probability at each call of the compute shader, to avoid (frequently) updating two neighboring pixels simultaneously. One could also alternate between updating the even or odd pixels at each step.\n\n6) By \"zooming out,\" what is meant, technically, is a renormalization operation whereby each 3x3 grid of pixels is replaced by just one pixel, which has a molecule exactly when 5 or more of the pixels in the 3x3 grid have molecules. But that is somewhat tough to simulate as the size has to increase by 9 at each step, so this video cheats a bit by just zooming out on a large simulation.\n\n7) The \"interesting behavior\" referenced here is the fact that the interface between the up and down sections of the picture can be rescaled (as the size of the model goes to infinity) in a way that yields a universal random curve called Schramm-Loewner evolution. This family of random curves shows up in many seemingly-unrelated places in statistical mechanics and probability.\n\nChapter markers:\n0:00 - What is phase change?\n6:27 - The Boltzmann law and free energy\n12:05 - A preliminary simulation\n15:30 - Defining temperature\n21:25 - Deriving the Boltzmann law\n24:30 - Sampling with MCMC\n28:30 - Chemical potential\n33:20 - Interesting properties\n\nThis video made use of the following Creative Commons material:\n\nhttps://commons.m.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:How_to_(nearly)_instantly_freeze_a_bottle_of_sparkling_water.ogv\n\nhttps://commons.m.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Blue_rotating_brain_animation.mpg\n\nhttps://commons.m.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:7_Tesla_MRI_of_the_ex_vivo_human_brain_at_100_micron_resolution_(100_micron_MRI_acquired_FA25_coronal).webm\n\nhttps://commons.m.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Axonal_nerve_fibers_in_a_brain_-_the_neural_network_that_is_us.webm",

For this reason, we animated these vectors as orthogonal-ish. See: https://proceedings.mlr.press/v119/wang20k/wang20k.pdf\n\nPer Chenyang Yuan: at 10:15, the blurry image that results when removing random noise in DDPM is probably due to a mismatch in noise levels when calling the denoiser. When the denoiser is called on x_{t-1} during DDPM sampling, it is expected to have a certain noise level (let's call it sigma_{t-1}). If you generate x_{t-1} from x_t without adding noise, then the noise present in x_{t-1} is always smaller than sigma_{t-1}. This causes the denoiser to remove too much noise, thus pointing towards the mean of the dataset. \n\nThe text conditioning input to stable diffusion is not the 512-dim text embedding vector, but the output of the layer before that, [with dimension 77x512](https://stackoverflow.com/a/79243065)\n\nFor the vectors at 31:40 - Some implementations use f(x, t, cat) + alpha(f(x, t, cat) - f(x, t)), and some that do f(x, t) + alpha(f(x, t, cat) - f(x, t)), where an alpha value of 1 corresponds to no guidance. I chose the second format here to keep things simpler.\n\nAt 30:30, the unconditional t=1 vector field looks a bit different from what it did at the 17:15 mark. This is the result of different models trained for different parts of the video, and likely a result of different random initializations.\n\n\nPremium Beat Music ID: EEDYZ3FP44YX8OWT",

Born from frustration with complex traditional NMS tools like Zabbix, it bridges legacy (SNMP/syslog) and modern (gNMI, OTLP) protocols for cloud-native environments.<p>We built ServiceRadar to simplify monitoring hybrid telecom networks, evolving it into a Kubernetes-native solution with Helm and Docker support. It uses mTLS with SPIFFE/SPIRE, NATS JetStream for event streaming (90M+ EPS), and SRQL for intuitive queries. Integrated with OpenTelemetry, Prometheus, and CloudEvents, it fills the network visibility gap in CNCF’s application-focused observability stack.<p>We’re seeking early adopters to try our demo or deploy locally—no sign-up needed.

    "body": "Deriving the Boltzmann formula, defining temperature, and simulating liquid/vapor.\n@SpectralCollective has the second part: https://youtu.be/yEcysu5xZH0\nYou can play with a simulation of this model here: https://vilas.us/simulations/liquidvapor/\nThese lessons are funded directly by viewers: https://3b1b.co/support\nHome page: https://www.3blue1brown.com\n\nNotes from Vilas:\n1) This open problem is to prove the ergodicity of the deterministic dynamical systems that are used to model the molecule-level physics. A good example of such a dynamical system is the box with particles evolving according to Newton's laws with elastic collisions, like in the video.\n\n2) This video assumes that all probability distributions are discrete, which is the case in the simulations. But one can also set up this formalism for systems with continuous state spaces. Again, a good example is particles in a box, which are not restricted to a lattice, which is only used for visualization purposes in this video.\n\n3) Strictly speaking, these \"derivatives\" don't make sense since in our simulations the energy can only take on a discrete set of values. But a derivative is the right way to think about this, and is the correct notion in a limiting sense.\n\n4) The factor of -T in the definition of the chemical potential is sort of a historical leftover, but including it has the convenient side effect of allowing the same Boltzmann formula to hold, with an energy function that depends on the chemical potential as well. It should also be noted that temperature must equalize in any situation where the chemical potential equalizes, since it is impossible for systems to exchange molecules without also exchanging energy.\n\n5) This algorithm, where we only choose one pixel at a time, is called Glauber dynamics. There are multiple ways to parallelize it, but the method chosen in this video is to only update each pixel with a low probability at each call of the compute shader, to avoid (frequently) updating two neighboring pixels simultaneously. One could also alternate between updating the even or odd pixels at each step.\n\n6) By \"zooming out,\" what is meant, technically, is a renormalization operation whereby each 3x3 grid of pixels is replaced by just one pixel, which has a molecule exactly when 5 or more of the pixels in the 3x3 grid have molecules. But that is somewhat tough to simulate as the size has to increase by 9 at each step, so this video cheats a bit by just zooming out on a large simulation.\n\n7) The \"interesting behavior\" referenced here is the fact that the interface between the up and down sections of the picture can be rescaled (as the size of the model goes to infinity) in a way that yields a universal random curve called Schramm-Loewner evolution. This family of random curves shows up in many seemingly-unrelated places in statistical mechanics and probability.\n\nChapter markers:\n0:00 - What is phase change?\n6:27 - The Boltzmann law and free energy\n12:05 - A preliminary simulation\n15:30 - Defining temperature\n21:25 - Deriving the Boltzmann law\n24:30 - Sampling with MCMC\n28:30 - Chemical potential\n33:20 - Interesting properties\n\nThis video made use of the following Creative Commons material:\n\nhttps://commons.m.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:How_to_(nearly)_instantly_freeze_a_bottle_of_sparkling_water.ogv\n\nhttps://commons.m.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Blue_rotating_brain_animation.mpg\n\nhttps://commons.m.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:7_Tesla_MRI_of_the_ex_vivo_human_brain_at_100_micron_resolution_(100_micron_MRI_acquired_FA25_coronal).webm\n\nhttps://commons.m.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Axonal_nerve_fibers_in_a_brain_-_the_neural_network_that_is_us.webm",

For this reason, we animated these vectors as orthogonal-ish. See: https://proceedings.mlr.press/v119/wang20k/wang20k.pdf\n\nPer Chenyang Yuan: at 10:15, the blurry image that results when removing random noise in DDPM is probably due to a mismatch in noise levels when calling the denoiser. When the denoiser is called on x_{t-1} during DDPM sampling, it is expected to have a certain noise level (let's call it sigma_{t-1}). If you generate x_{t-1} from x_t without adding noise, then the noise present in x_{t-1} is always smaller than sigma_{t-1}. This causes the denoiser to remove too much noise, thus pointing towards the mean of the dataset. \n\nThe text conditioning input to stable diffusion is not the 512-dim text embedding vector, but the output of the layer before that, [with dimension 77x512](https://stackoverflow.com/a/79243065)\n\nFor the vectors at 31:40 - Some implementations use f(x, t, cat) + alpha(f(x, t, cat) - f(x, t)), and some that do f(x, t) + alpha(f(x, t, cat) - f(x, t)), where an alpha value of 1 corresponds to no guidance. I chose the second format here to keep things simpler.\n\nAt 30:30, the unconditional t=1 vector field looks a bit different from what it did at the 17:15 mark. This is the result of different models trained for different parts of the video, and likely a result of different random initializations.\n\n\nPremium Beat Music ID: EEDYZ3FP44YX8OWT",

    "body": "Deriving the Boltzmann formula, defining temperature, and simulating liquid/vapor.\n@SpectralCollective has the second part: https://youtu.be/yEcysu5xZH0\nYou can play with a simulation of this model here: https://vilas.us/simulations/liquidvapor/\nThese lessons are funded directly by viewers: https://3b1b.co/support\nHome page: https://www.3blue1brown.com\n\nNotes from Vilas:\n1) This open problem is to prove the ergodicity of the deterministic dynamical systems that are used to model the molecule-level physics. A good example of such a dynamical system is the box with particles evolving according to Newton's laws with elastic collisions, like in the video.\n\n2) This video assumes that all probability distributions are discrete, which is the case in the simulations. But one can also set up this formalism for systems with continuous state spaces. Again, a good example is particles in a box, which are not restricted to a lattice, which is only used for visualization purposes in this video.\n\n3) Strictly speaking, these \"derivatives\" don't make sense since in our simulations the energy can only take on a discrete set of values. But a derivative is the right way to think about this, and is the correct notion in a limiting sense.\n\n4) The factor of -T in the definition of the chemical potential is sort of a historical leftover, but including it has the convenient side effect of allowing the same Boltzmann formula to hold, with an energy function that depends on the chemical potential as well. It should also be noted that temperature must equalize in any situation where the chemical potential equalizes, since it is impossible for systems to exchange molecules without also exchanging energy.\n\n5) This algorithm, where we only choose one pixel at a time, is called Glauber dynamics. There are multiple ways to parallelize it, but the method chosen in this video is to only update each pixel with a low probability at each call of the compute shader, to avoid (frequently) updating two neighboring pixels simultaneously. One could also alternate between updating the even or odd pixels at each step.\n\n6) By \"zooming out,\" what is meant, technically, is a renormalization operation whereby each 3x3 grid of pixels is replaced by just one pixel, which has a molecule exactly when 5 or more of the pixels in the 3x3 grid have molecules. But that is somewhat tough to simulate as the size has to increase by 9 at each step, so this video cheats a bit by just zooming out on a large simulation.\n\n7) The \"interesting behavior\" referenced here is the fact that the interface between the up and down sections of the picture can be rescaled (as the size of the model goes to infinity) in a way that yields a universal random curve called Schramm-Loewner evolution. This family of random curves shows up in many seemingly-unrelated places in statistical mechanics and probability.\n\nChapter markers:\n0:00 - What is phase change?\n6:27 - The Boltzmann law and free energy\n12:05 - A preliminary simulation\n15:30 - Defining temperature\n21:25 - Deriving the Boltzmann law\n24:30 - Sampling with MCMC\n28:30 - Chemical potential\n33:20 - Interesting properties\n\nThis video made use of the following Creative Commons material:\n\nhttps://commons.m.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:How_to_(nearly)_instantly_freeze_a_bottle_of_sparkling_water.ogv\n\nhttps://commons.m.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Blue_rotating_brain_animation.mpg\n\nhttps://commons.m.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:7_Tesla_MRI_of_the_ex_vivo_human_brain_at_100_micron_resolution_(100_micron_MRI_acquired_FA25_coronal).webm\n\nhttps://commons.m.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Axonal_nerve_fibers_in_a_brain_-_the_neural_network_that_is_us.webm",

For this reason, we animated these vectors as orthogonal-ish. See: https://proceedings.mlr.press/v119/wang20k/wang20k.pdf\n\nPer Chenyang Yuan: at 10:15, the blurry image that results when removing random noise in DDPM is probably due to a mismatch in noise levels when calling the denoiser. When the denoiser is called on x_{t-1} during DDPM sampling, it is expected to have a certain noise level (let's call it sigma_{t-1}). If you generate x_{t-1} from x_t without adding noise, then the noise present in x_{t-1} is always smaller than sigma_{t-1}. This causes the denoiser to remove too much noise, thus pointing towards the mean of the dataset. \n\nThe text conditioning input to stable diffusion is not the 512-dim text embedding vector, but the output of the layer before that, [with dimension 77x512](https://stackoverflow.com/a/79243065)\n\nFor the vectors at 31:40 - Some implementations use f(x, t, cat) + alpha(f(x, t, cat) - f(x, t)), and some that do f(x, t) + alpha(f(x, t, cat) - f(x, t)), where an alpha value of 1 corresponds to no guidance. I chose the second format here to keep things simpler.\n\nAt 30:30, the unconditional t=1 vector field looks a bit different from what it did at the 17:15 mark. This is the result of different models trained for different parts of the video, and likely a result of different random initializations.\n\n\nPremium Beat Music ID: EEDYZ3FP44YX8OWT",

    "body": "Deriving the Boltzmann formula, defining temperature, and simulating liquid/vapor.\n@SpectralCollective has the second part: https://youtu.be/yEcysu5xZH0\nYou can play with a simulation of this model here: https://vilas.us/simulations/liquidvapor/\nThese lessons are funded directly by viewers: https://3b1b.co/support\nHome page: https://www.3blue1brown.com\n\nNotes from Vilas:\n1) This open problem is to prove the ergodicity of the deterministic dynamical systems that are used to model the molecule-level physics. A good example of such a dynamical system is the box with particles evolving according to Newton's laws with elastic collisions, like in the video.\n\n2) This video assumes that all probability distributions are discrete, which is the case in the simulations. But one can also set up this formalism for systems with continuous state spaces. Again, a good example is particles in a box, which are not restricted to a lattice, which is only used for visualization purposes in this video.\n\n3) Strictly speaking, these \"derivatives\" don't make sense since in our simulations the energy can only take on a discrete set of values. But a derivative is the right way to think about this, and is the correct notion in a limiting sense.\n\n4) The factor of -T in the definition of the chemical potential is sort of a historical leftover, but including it has the convenient side effect of allowing the same Boltzmann formula to hold, with an energy function that depends on the chemical potential as well. It should also be noted that temperature must equalize in any situation where the chemical potential equalizes, since it is impossible for systems to exchange molecules without also exchanging energy.\n\n5) This algorithm, where we only choose one pixel at a time, is called Glauber dynamics. There are multiple ways to parallelize it, but the method chosen in this video is to only update each pixel with a low probability at each call of the compute shader, to avoid (frequently) updating two neighboring pixels simultaneously. One could also alternate between updating the even or odd pixels at each step.\n\n6) By \"zooming out,\" what is meant, technically, is a renormalization operation whereby each 3x3 grid of pixels is replaced by just one pixel, which has a molecule exactly when 5 or more of the pixels in the 3x3 grid have molecules. But that is somewhat tough to simulate as the size has to increase by 9 at each step, so this video cheats a bit by just zooming out on a large simulation.\n\n7) The \"interesting behavior\" referenced here is the fact that the interface between the up and down sections of the picture can be rescaled (as the size of the model goes to infinity) in a way that yields a universal random curve called Schramm-Loewner evolution. This family of random curves shows up in many seemingly-unrelated places in statistical mechanics and probability.\n\nChapter markers:\n0:00 - What is phase change?\n6:27 - The Boltzmann law and free energy\n12:05 - A preliminary simulation\n15:30 - Defining temperature\n21:25 - Deriving the Boltzmann law\n24:30 - Sampling with MCMC\n28:30 - Chemical potential\n33:20 - Interesting properties\n\nThis video made use of the following Creative Commons material:\n\nhttps://commons.m.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:How_to_(nearly)_instantly_freeze_a_bottle_of_sparkling_water.ogv\n\nhttps://commons.m.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Blue_rotating_brain_animation.mpg\n\nhttps://commons.m.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:7_Tesla_MRI_of_the_ex_vivo_human_brain_at_100_micron_resolution_(100_micron_MRI_acquired_FA25_coronal).webm\n\nhttps://commons.m.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Axonal_nerve_fibers_in_a_brain_-_the_neural_network_that_is_us.webm",

For this reason, we animated these vectors as orthogonal-ish. See: https://proceedings.mlr.press/v119/wang20k/wang20k.pdf\n\nPer Chenyang Yuan: at 10:15, the blurry image that results when removing random noise in DDPM is probably due to a mismatch in noise levels when calling the denoiser. When the denoiser is called on x_{t-1} during DDPM sampling, it is expected to have a certain noise level (let's call it sigma_{t-1}). If you generate x_{t-1} from x_t without adding noise, then the noise present in x_{t-1} is always smaller than sigma_{t-1}. This causes the denoiser to remove too much noise, thus pointing towards the mean of the dataset. \n\nThe text conditioning input to stable diffusion is not the 512-dim text embedding vector, but the output of the layer before that, [with dimension 77x512](https://stackoverflow.com/a/79243065)\n\nFor the vectors at 31:40 - Some implementations use f(x, t, cat) + alpha(f(x, t, cat) - f(x, t)), and some that do f(x, t) + alpha(f(x, t, cat) - f(x, t)), where an alpha value of 1 corresponds to no guidance. I chose the second format here to keep things simpler.\n\nAt 30:30, the unconditional t=1 vector field looks a bit different from what it did at the 17:15 mark. This is the result of different models trained for different parts of the video, and likely a result of different random initializations.\n\n\nPremium Beat Music ID: EEDYZ3FP44YX8OWT",

    "body": "<p>ServiceRadar is an open-source platform for distributed, secure network management and observability, scaling to 100k+ devices. Born from frustration with complex traditional NMS tools like Zabbix, it bridges legacy (SNMP/syslog) and modern (gNMI, OTLP) protocols for cloud-native environments.<p>We built ServiceRadar to simplify monitoring hybrid telecom networks, evolving it into a Kubernetes-native solution with Helm and Docker support. It uses mTLS with SPIFFE/SPIRE, NATS JetStream for event streaming (90M+ EPS), and SRQL for intuitive queries. Integrated with OpenTelemetry, Prometheus, and CloudEvents, it fills the network visibility gap in CNCF’s application-focused observability stack.<p>We’re seeking early adopters to try our demo or deploy locally—no sign-up needed. Feedback on usability or contributions for new protocols would be awesome.<p>Quick Start: helm install serviceradar carverauto/serviceradar or docker compose up -d<p>GitHub: <a href=\"https://github.com/carverauto/serviceradar\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/carverauto/serviceradar</a> (please star!)<p>Docs: <a href=\"https://docs.serviceradar.cloud\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://docs.serviceradar.cloud</a><p>Join our Discord or use GitHub Issues to share thoughts.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45624186\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45624186</a></p>\n<p>Points: 33</p>\n<p># Comments: 1</p>",

    "body": "Deriving the Boltzmann formula, defining temperature, and simulating liquid/vapor.\n@SpectralCollective has the second part: https://youtu.be/yEcysu5xZH0\nYou can play with a simulation of this model here: https://vilas.us/simulations/liquidvapor/\nThese lessons are funded directly by viewers: https://3b1b.co/support\nHome page: https://www.3blue1brown.com\n\nNotes from Vilas:\n1) This open problem is to prove the ergodicity of the deterministic dynamical systems that are used to model the molecule-level physics. A good example of such a dynamical system is the box with particles evolving according to Newton's laws with elastic collisions, like in the video.\n\n2) This video assumes that all probability distributions are discrete, which is the case in the simulations. But one can also set up this formalism for systems with continuous state spaces. Again, a good example is particles in a box, which are not restricted to a lattice, which is only used for visualization purposes in this video.\n\n3) Strictly speaking, these \"derivatives\" don't make sense since in our simulations the energy can only take on a discrete set of values. But a derivative is the right way to think about this, and is the correct notion in a limiting sense.\n\n4) The factor of -T in the definition of the chemical potential is sort of a historical leftover, but including it has the convenient side effect of allowing the same Boltzmann formula to hold, with an energy function that depends on the chemical potential as well. It should also be noted that temperature must equalize in any situation where the chemical potential equalizes, since it is impossible for systems to exchange molecules without also exchanging energy.\n\n5) This algorithm, where we only choose one pixel at a time, is called Glauber dynamics. There are multiple ways to parallelize it, but the method chosen in this video is to only update each pixel with a low probability at each call of the compute shader, to avoid (frequently) updating two neighboring pixels simultaneously. One could also alternate between updating the even or odd pixels at each step.\n\n6) By \"zooming out,\" what is meant, technically, is a renormalization operation whereby each 3x3 grid of pixels is replaced by just one pixel, which has a molecule exactly when 5 or more of the pixels in the 3x3 grid have molecules. But that is somewhat tough to simulate as the size has to increase by 9 at each step, so this video cheats a bit by just zooming out on a large simulation.\n\n7) The \"interesting behavior\" referenced here is the fact that the interface between the up and down sections of the picture can be rescaled (as the size of the model goes to infinity) in a way that yields a universal random curve called Schramm-Loewner evolution. This family of random curves shows up in many seemingly-unrelated places in statistical mechanics and probability.\n\nChapter markers:\n0:00 - What is phase change?\n6:27 - The Boltzmann law and free energy\n12:05 - A preliminary simulation\n15:30 - Defining temperature\n21:25 - Deriving the Boltzmann law\n24:30 - Sampling with MCMC\n28:30 - Chemical potential\n33:20 - Interesting properties\n\nThis video made use of the following Creative Commons material:\n\nhttps://commons.m.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:How_to_(nearly)_instantly_freeze_a_bottle_of_sparkling_water.ogv\n\nhttps://commons.m.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Blue_rotating_brain_animation.mpg\n\nhttps://commons.m.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:7_Tesla_MRI_of_the_ex_vivo_human_brain_at_100_micron_resolution_(100_micron_MRI_acquired_FA25_coronal).webm\n\nhttps://commons.m.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Axonal_nerve_fibers_in_a_brain_-_the_neural_network_that_is_us.webm",

For this reason, we animated these vectors as orthogonal-ish. See: https://proceedings.mlr.press/v119/wang20k/wang20k.pdf\n\nPer Chenyang Yuan: at 10:15, the blurry image that results when removing random noise in DDPM is probably due to a mismatch in noise levels when calling the denoiser. When the denoiser is called on x_{t-1} during DDPM sampling, it is expected to have a certain noise level (let's call it sigma_{t-1}). If you generate x_{t-1} from x_t without adding noise, then the noise present in x_{t-1} is always smaller than sigma_{t-1}. This causes the denoiser to remove too much noise, thus pointing towards the mean of the dataset. \n\nThe text conditioning input to stable diffusion is not the 512-dim text embedding vector, but the output of the layer before that, [with dimension 77x512](https://stackoverflow.com/a/79243065)\n\nFor the vectors at 31:40 - Some implementations use f(x, t, cat) + alpha(f(x, t, cat) - f(x, t)), and some that do f(x, t) + alpha(f(x, t, cat) - f(x, t)), where an alpha value of 1 corresponds to no guidance. I chose the second format here to keep things simpler.\n\nAt 30:30, the unconditional t=1 vector field looks a bit different from what it did at the 17:15 mark. This is the result of different models trained for different parts of the video, and likely a result of different random initializations.\n\n\nPremium Beat Music ID: EEDYZ3FP44YX8OWT",

    "title": "Simulating and understanding phase change | Guest video by Vilas Winstein",
    "body": "Deriving the Boltzmann formula, defining temperature, and simulating liquid/vapor.\n@SpectralCollective has the second part: https://youtu.be/yEcysu5xZH0\nYou can play with a simulation of this model here: https://vilas.us/simulations/liquidvapor/\nThese lessons are funded directly by viewers: https://3b1b.co/support\nHome page: https://www.3blue1brown.com\n\nNotes from Vilas:\n1) This open problem is to prove the ergodicity of the deterministic dynamical systems that are used to model the molecule-level physics. A good example of such a dynamical system is the box with particles evolving according to Newton's laws with elastic collisions, like in the video.\n\n2) This video assumes that all probability distributions are discrete, which is the case in the simulations. But one can also set up this formalism for systems with continuous state spaces. Again, a good example is particles in a box, which are not restricted to a lattice, which is only used for visualization purposes in this video.\n\n3) Strictly speaking, these \"derivatives\" don't make sense since in our simulations the energy can only take on a discrete set of values. But a derivative is the right way to think about this, and is the correct notion in a limiting sense.\n\n4) The factor of -T in the definition of the chemical potential is sort of a historical leftover, but including it has the convenient side effect of allowing the same Boltzmann formula to hold, with an energy function that depends on the chemical potential as well. It should also be noted that temperature must equalize in any situation where the chemical potential equalizes, since it is impossible for systems to exchange molecules without also exchanging energy.\n\n5) This algorithm, where we only choose one pixel at a time, is called Glauber dynamics. There are multiple ways to parallelize it, but the method chosen in this video is to only update each pixel with a low probability at each call of the compute shader, to avoid (frequently) updating two neighboring pixels simultaneously. One could also alternate between updating the even or odd pixels at each step.\n\n6) By \"zooming out,\" what is meant, technically, is a renormalization operation whereby each 3x3 grid of pixels is replaced by just one pixel, which has a molecule exactly when 5 or more of the pixels in the 3x3 grid have molecules. But that is somewhat tough to simulate as the size has to increase by 9 at each step, so this video cheats a bit by just zooming out on a large simulation.\n\n7) The \"interesting behavior\" referenced here is the fact that the interface between the up and down sections of the picture can be rescaled (as the size of the model goes to infinity) in a way that yields a universal random curve called Schramm-Loewner evolution. This family of random curves shows up in many seemingly-unrelated places in statistical mechanics and probability.\n\nChapter markers:\n0:00 - What is phase change?\n6:27 - The Boltzmann law and free energy\n12:05 - A preliminary simulation\n15:30 - Defining temperature\n21:25 - Deriving the Boltzmann law\n24:30 - Sampling with MCMC\n28:30 - Chemical potential\n33:20 - Interesting properties\n\nThis video made use of the following Creative Commons material:\n\nhttps://commons.m.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:How_to_(nearly)_instantly_freeze_a_bottle_of_sparkling_water.ogv\n\nhttps://commons.m.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Blue_rotating_brain_animation.mpg\n\nhttps://commons.m.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:7_Tesla_MRI_of_the_ex_vivo_human_brain_at_100_micron_resolution_(100_micron_MRI_acquired_FA25_coronal).webm\n\nhttps://commons.m.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Axonal_nerve_fibers_in_a_brain_-_the_neural_network_that_is_us.webm",

For this reason, we animated these vectors as orthogonal-ish. See: https://proceedings.mlr.press/v119/wang20k/wang20k.pdf\n\nPer Chenyang Yuan: at 10:15, the blurry image that results when removing random noise in DDPM is probably due to a mismatch in noise levels when calling the denoiser. When the denoiser is called on x_{t-1} during DDPM sampling, it is expected to have a certain noise level (let's call it sigma_{t-1}). If you generate x_{t-1} from x_t without adding noise, then the noise present in x_{t-1} is always smaller than sigma_{t-1}. This causes the denoiser to remove too much noise, thus pointing towards the mean of the dataset. \n\nThe text conditioning input to stable diffusion is not the 512-dim text embedding vector, but the output of the layer before that, [with dimension 77x512](https://stackoverflow.com/a/79243065)\n\nFor the vectors at 31:40 - Some implementations use f(x, t, cat) + alpha(f(x, t, cat) - f(x, t)), and some that do f(x, t) + alpha(f(x, t, cat) - f(x, t)), where an alpha value of 1 corresponds to no guidance. I chose the second format here to keep things simpler.\n\nAt 30:30, the unconditional t=1 vector field looks a bit different from what it did at the 17:15 mark. This is the result of different models trained for different parts of the video, and likely a result of different random initializations.\n\n\nPremium Beat Music ID: EEDYZ3FP44YX8OWT",

    "body": "Deriving the Boltzmann formula, defining temperature, and simulating liquid/vapor.\n@SpectralCollective has the second part: https://youtu.be/yEcysu5xZH0\nYou can play with a simulation of this model here: https://vilas.us/simulations/liquidvapor/\nThese lessons are funded directly by viewers: https://3b1b.co/support\nHome page: https://www.3blue1brown.com\n\nNotes from Vilas:\n1) This open problem is to prove the ergodicity of the deterministic dynamical systems that are used to model the molecule-level physics. A good example of such a dynamical system is the box with particles evolving according to Newton's laws with elastic collisions, like in the video.\n\n2) This video assumes that all probability distributions are discrete, which is the case in the simulations. But one can also set up this formalism for systems with continuous state spaces. Again, a good example is particles in a box, which are not restricted to a lattice, which is only used for visualization purposes in this video.\n\n3) Strictly speaking, these \"derivatives\" don't make sense since in our simulations the energy can only take on a discrete set of values. But a derivative is the right way to think about this, and is the correct notion in a limiting sense.\n\n4) The factor of -T in the definition of the chemical potential is sort of a historical leftover, but including it has the convenient side effect of allowing the same Boltzmann formula to hold, with an energy function that depends on the chemical potential as well. It should also be noted that temperature must equalize in any situation where the chemical potential equalizes, since it is impossible for systems to exchange molecules without also exchanging energy.\n\n5) This algorithm, where we only choose one pixel at a time, is called Glauber dynamics. There are multiple ways to parallelize it, but the method chosen in this video is to only update each pixel with a low probability at each call of the compute shader, to avoid (frequently) updating two neighboring pixels simultaneously. One could also alternate between updating the even or odd pixels at each step.\n\n6) By \"zooming out,\" what is meant, technically, is a renormalization operation whereby each 3x3 grid of pixels is replaced by just one pixel, which has a molecule exactly when 5 or more of the pixels in the 3x3 grid have molecules. But that is somewhat tough to simulate as the size has to increase by 9 at each step, so this video cheats a bit by just zooming out on a large simulation.\n\n7) The \"interesting behavior\" referenced here is the fact that the interface between the up and down sections of the picture can be rescaled (as the size of the model goes to infinity) in a way that yields a universal random curve called Schramm-Loewner evolution. This family of random curves shows up in many seemingly-unrelated places in statistical mechanics and probability.\n\nChapter markers:\n0:00 - What is phase change?\n6:27 - The Boltzmann law and free energy\n12:05 - A preliminary simulation\n15:30 - Defining temperature\n21:25 - Deriving the Boltzmann law\n24:30 - Sampling with MCMC\n28:30 - Chemical potential\n33:20 - Interesting properties\n\nThis video made use of the following Creative Commons material:\n\nhttps://commons.m.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:How_to_(nearly)_instantly_freeze_a_bottle_of_sparkling_water.ogv\n\nhttps://commons.m.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Blue_rotating_brain_animation.mpg\n\nhttps://commons.m.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:7_Tesla_MRI_of_the_ex_vivo_human_brain_at_100_micron_resolution_(100_micron_MRI_acquired_FA25_coronal).webm\n\nhttps://commons.m.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Axonal_nerve_fibers_in_a_brain_-_the_neural_network_that_is_us.webm",

For this reason, we animated these vectors as orthogonal-ish. See: https://proceedings.mlr.press/v119/wang20k/wang20k.pdf\n\nPer Chenyang Yuan: at 10:15, the blurry image that results when removing random noise in DDPM is probably due to a mismatch in noise levels when calling the denoiser. When the denoiser is called on x_{t-1} during DDPM sampling, it is expected to have a certain noise level (let's call it sigma_{t-1}). If you generate x_{t-1} from x_t without adding noise, then the noise present in x_{t-1} is always smaller than sigma_{t-1}. This causes the denoiser to remove too much noise, thus pointing towards the mean of the dataset. \n\nThe text conditioning input to stable diffusion is not the 512-dim text embedding vector, but the output of the layer before that, [with dimension 77x512](https://stackoverflow.com/a/79243065)\n\nFor the vectors at 31:40 - Some implementations use f(x, t, cat) + alpha(f(x, t, cat) - f(x, t)), and some that do f(x, t) + alpha(f(x, t, cat) - f(x, t)), where an alpha value of 1 corresponds to no guidance. I chose the second format here to keep things simpler.\n\nAt 30:30, the unconditional t=1 vector field looks a bit different from what it did at the 17:15 mark. This is the result of different models trained for different parts of the video, and likely a result of different random initializations.\n\n\nPremium Beat Music ID: EEDYZ3FP44YX8OWT",

    "body": "Deriving the Boltzmann formula, defining temperature, and simulating liquid/vapor.\n@SpectralCollective has the second part: https://youtu.be/yEcysu5xZH0\nYou can play with a simulation of this model here: https://vilas.us/simulations/liquidvapor/\nThese lessons are funded directly by viewers: https://3b1b.co/support\nHome page: https://www.3blue1brown.com\n\nNotes from Vilas:\n1) This open problem is to prove the ergodicity of the deterministic dynamical systems that are used to model the molecule-level physics. A good example of such a dynamical system is the box with particles evolving according to Newton's laws with elastic collisions, like in the video.\n\n2) This video assumes that all probability distributions are discrete, which is the case in the simulations. But one can also set up this formalism for systems with continuous state spaces. Again, a good example is particles in a box, which are not restricted to a lattice, which is only used for visualization purposes in this video.\n\n3) Strictly speaking, these \"derivatives\" don't make sense since in our simulations the energy can only take on a discrete set of values. But a derivative is the right way to think about this, and is the correct notion in a limiting sense.\n\n4) The factor of -T in the definition of the chemical potential is sort of a historical leftover, but including it has the convenient side effect of allowing the same Boltzmann formula to hold, with an energy function that depends on the chemical potential as well. It should also be noted that temperature must equalize in any situation where the chemical potential equalizes, since it is impossible for systems to exchange molecules without also exchanging energy.\n\n5) This algorithm, where we only choose one pixel at a time, is called Glauber dynamics. There are multiple ways to parallelize it, but the method chosen in this video is to only update each pixel with a low probability at each call of the compute shader, to avoid (frequently) updating two neighboring pixels simultaneously. One could also alternate between updating the even or odd pixels at each step.\n\n6) By \"zooming out,\" what is meant, technically, is a renormalization operation whereby each 3x3 grid of pixels is replaced by just one pixel, which has a molecule exactly when 5 or more of the pixels in the 3x3 grid have molecules. But that is somewhat tough to simulate as the size has to increase by 9 at each step, so this video cheats a bit by just zooming out on a large simulation.\n\n7) The \"interesting behavior\" referenced here is the fact that the interface between the up and down sections of the picture can be rescaled (as the size of the model goes to infinity) in a way that yields a universal random curve called Schramm-Loewner evolution. This family of random curves shows up in many seemingly-unrelated places in statistical mechanics and probability.\n\nChapter markers:\n0:00 - What is phase change?\n6:27 - The Boltzmann law and free energy\n12:05 - A preliminary simulation\n15:30 - Defining temperature\n21:25 - Deriving the Boltzmann law\n24:30 - Sampling with MCMC\n28:30 - Chemical potential\n33:20 - Interesting properties\n\nThis video made use of the following Creative Commons material:\n\nhttps://commons.m.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:How_to_(nearly)_instantly_freeze_a_bottle_of_sparkling_water.ogv\n\nhttps://commons.m.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Blue_rotating_brain_animation.mpg\n\nhttps://commons.m.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:7_Tesla_MRI_of_the_ex_vivo_human_brain_at_100_micron_resolution_(100_micron_MRI_acquired_FA25_coronal).webm\n\nhttps://commons.m.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Axonal_nerve_fibers_in_a_brain_-_the_neural_network_that_is_us.webm",

For this reason, we animated these vectors as orthogonal-ish. See: https://proceedings.mlr.press/v119/wang20k/wang20k.pdf\n\nPer Chenyang Yuan: at 10:15, the blurry image that results when removing random noise in DDPM is probably due to a mismatch in noise levels when calling the denoiser. When the denoiser is called on x_{t-1} during DDPM sampling, it is expected to have a certain noise level (let's call it sigma_{t-1}). If you generate x_{t-1} from x_t without adding noise, then the noise present in x_{t-1} is always smaller than sigma_{t-1}. This causes the denoiser to remove too much noise, thus pointing towards the mean of the dataset. \n\nThe text conditioning input to stable diffusion is not the 512-dim text embedding vector, but the output of the layer before that, [with dimension 77x512](https://stackoverflow.com/a/79243065)\n\nFor the vectors at 31:40 - Some implementations use f(x, t, cat) + alpha(f(x, t, cat) - f(x, t)), and some that do f(x, t) + alpha(f(x, t, cat) - f(x, t)), where an alpha value of 1 corresponds to no guidance. I chose the second format here to keep things simpler.\n\nAt 30:30, the unconditional t=1 vector field looks a bit different from what it did at the 17:15 mark. This is the result of different models trained for different parts of the video, and likely a result of different random initializations.\n\n\nPremium Beat Music ID: EEDYZ3FP44YX8OWT",

    "body": "<p>ServiceRadar is an open-source platform for distributed, secure network management and observability, scaling to 100k+ devices. Born from frustration with complex traditional NMS tools like Zabbix, it bridges legacy (SNMP/syslog) and modern (gNMI, OTLP) protocols for cloud-native environments.<p>We built ServiceRadar to simplify monitoring hybrid telecom networks, evolving it into a Kubernetes-native solution with Helm and Docker support. It uses mTLS with SPIFFE/SPIRE, NATS JetStream for event streaming (90M+ EPS), and SRQL for intuitive queries. Integrated with OpenTelemetry, Prometheus, and CloudEvents, it fills the network visibility gap in CNCF’s application-focused observability stack.<p>We’re seeking early adopters to try our demo or deploy locally—no sign-up needed. Feedback on usability or contributions for new protocols would be awesome.<p>Quick Start: helm install serviceradar carverauto/serviceradar or docker compose up -d<p>GitHub: <a href=\"https://github.com/carverauto/serviceradar\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/carverauto/serviceradar</a> (please star!)<p>Docs: <a href=\"https://docs.serviceradar.cloud\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://docs.serviceradar.cloud</a><p>Join our Discord or use GitHub Issues to share thoughts.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45624186\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45624186</a></p>\n<p>Points: 33</p>\n<p># Comments: 1</p>",

    "body": "Deriving the Boltzmann formula, defining temperature, and simulating liquid/vapor.\n@SpectralCollective has the second part: https://youtu.be/yEcysu5xZH0\nYou can play with a simulation of this model here: https://vilas.us/simulations/liquidvapor/\nThese lessons are funded directly by viewers: https://3b1b.co/support\nHome page: https://www.3blue1brown.com\n\nNotes from Vilas:\n1) This open problem is to prove the ergodicity of the deterministic dynamical systems that are used to model the molecule-level physics. A good example of such a dynamical system is the box with particles evolving according to Newton's laws with elastic collisions, like in the video.\n\n2) This video assumes that all probability distributions are discrete, which is the case in the simulations. But one can also set up this formalism for systems with continuous state spaces. Again, a good example is particles in a box, which are not restricted to a lattice, which is only used for visualization purposes in this video.\n\n3) Strictly speaking, these \"derivatives\" don't make sense since in our simulations the energy can only take on a discrete set of values. But a derivative is the right way to think about this, and is the correct notion in a limiting sense.\n\n4) The factor of -T in the definition of the chemical potential is sort of a historical leftover, but including it has the convenient side effect of allowing the same Boltzmann formula to hold, with an energy function that depends on the chemical potential as well. It should also be noted that temperature must equalize in any situation where the chemical potential equalizes, since it is impossible for systems to exchange molecules without also exchanging energy.\n\n5) This algorithm, where we only choose one pixel at a time, is called Glauber dynamics. There are multiple ways to parallelize it, but the method chosen in this video is to only update each pixel with a low probability at each call of the compute shader, to avoid (frequently) updating two neighboring pixels simultaneously. One could also alternate between updating the even or odd pixels at each step.\n\n6) By \"zooming out,\" what is meant, technically, is a renormalization operation whereby each 3x3 grid of pixels is replaced by just one pixel, which has a molecule exactly when 5 or more of the pixels in the 3x3 grid have molecules. But that is somewhat tough to simulate as the size has to increase by 9 at each step, so this video cheats a bit by just zooming out on a large simulation.\n\n7) The \"interesting behavior\" referenced here is the fact that the interface between the up and down sections of the picture can be rescaled (as the size of the model goes to infinity) in a way that yields a universal random curve called Schramm-Loewner evolution. This family of random curves shows up in many seemingly-unrelated places in statistical mechanics and probability.\n\nChapter markers:\n0:00 - What is phase change?\n6:27 - The Boltzmann law and free energy\n12:05 - A preliminary simulation\n15:30 - Defining temperature\n21:25 - Deriving the Boltzmann law\n24:30 - Sampling with MCMC\n28:30 - Chemical potential\n33:20 - Interesting properties\n\nThis video made use of the following Creative Commons material:\n\nhttps://commons.m.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:How_to_(nearly)_instantly_freeze_a_bottle_of_sparkling_water.ogv\n\nhttps://commons.m.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Blue_rotating_brain_animation.mpg\n\nhttps://commons.m.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:7_Tesla_MRI_of_the_ex_vivo_human_brain_at_100_micron_resolution_(100_micron_MRI_acquired_FA25_coronal).webm\n\nhttps://commons.m.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Axonal_nerve_fibers_in_a_brain_-_the_neural_network_that_is_us.webm",

For this reason, we animated these vectors as orthogonal-ish. See: https://proceedings.mlr.press/v119/wang20k/wang20k.pdf\n\nPer Chenyang Yuan: at 10:15, the blurry image that results when removing random noise in DDPM is probably due to a mismatch in noise levels when calling the denoiser. When the denoiser is called on x_{t-1} during DDPM sampling, it is expected to have a certain noise level (let's call it sigma_{t-1}). If you generate x_{t-1} from x_t without adding noise, then the noise present in x_{t-1} is always smaller than sigma_{t-1}. This causes the denoiser to remove too much noise, thus pointing towards the mean of the dataset. \n\nThe text conditioning input to stable diffusion is not the 512-dim text embedding vector, but the output of the layer before that, [with dimension 77x512](https://stackoverflow.com/a/79243065)\n\nFor the vectors at 31:40 - Some implementations use f(x, t, cat) + alpha(f(x, t, cat) - f(x, t)), and some that do f(x, t) + alpha(f(x, t, cat) - f(x, t)), where an alpha value of 1 corresponds to no guidance. I chose the second format here to keep things simpler.\n\nAt 30:30, the unconditional t=1 vector field looks a bit different from what it did at the 17:15 mark. This is the result of different models trained for different parts of the video, and likely a result of different random initializations.\n\n\nPremium Beat Music ID: EEDYZ3FP44YX8OWT",

    "title": "Simulating and understanding phase change | Guest video by Vilas Winstein",
    "body": "Deriving the Boltzmann formula, defining temperature, and simulating liquid/vapor.\n@SpectralCollective has the second part: https://youtu.be/yEcysu5xZH0\nYou can play with a simulation of this model here: https://vilas.us/simulations/liquidvapor/\nThese lessons are funded directly by viewers: https://3b1b.co/support\nHome page: https://www.3blue1brown.com\n\nNotes from Vilas:\n1) This open problem is to prove the ergodicity of the deterministic dynamical systems that are used to model the molecule-level physics. A good example of such a dynamical system is the box with particles evolving according to Newton's laws with elastic collisions, like in the video.\n\n2) This video assumes that all probability distributions are discrete, which is the case in the simulations. But one can also set up this formalism for systems with continuous state spaces. Again, a good example is particles in a box, which are not restricted to a lattice, which is only used for visualization purposes in this video.\n\n3) Strictly speaking, these \"derivatives\" don't make sense since in our simulations the energy can only take on a discrete set of values. But a derivative is the right way to think about this, and is the correct notion in a limiting sense.\n\n4) The factor of -T in the definition of the chemical potential is sort of a historical leftover, but including it has the convenient side effect of allowing the same Boltzmann formula to hold, with an energy function that depends on the chemical potential as well. It should also be noted that temperature must equalize in any situation where the chemical potential equalizes, since it is impossible for systems to exchange molecules without also exchanging energy.\n\n5) This algorithm, where we only choose one pixel at a time, is called Glauber dynamics. There are multiple ways to parallelize it, but the method chosen in this video is to only update each pixel with a low probability at each call of the compute shader, to avoid (frequently) updating two neighboring pixels simultaneously. One could also alternate between updating the even or odd pixels at each step.\n\n6) By \"zooming out,\" what is meant, technically, is a renormalization operation whereby each 3x3 grid of pixels is replaced by just one pixel, which has a molecule exactly when 5 or more of the pixels in the 3x3 grid have molecules. But that is somewhat tough to simulate as the size has to increase by 9 at each step, so this video cheats a bit by just zooming out on a large simulation.\n\n7) The \"interesting behavior\" referenced here is the fact that the interface between the up and down sections of the picture can be rescaled (as the size of the model goes to infinity) in a way that yields a universal random curve called Schramm-Loewner evolution. This family of random curves shows up in many seemingly-unrelated places in statistical mechanics and probability.\n\nChapter markers:\n0:00 - What is phase change?\n6:27 - The Boltzmann law and free energy\n12:05 - A preliminary simulation\n15:30 - Defining temperature\n21:25 - Deriving the Boltzmann law\n24:30 - Sampling with MCMC\n28:30 - Chemical potential\n33:20 - Interesting properties\n\nThis video made use of the following Creative Commons material:\n\nhttps://commons.m.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:How_to_(nearly)_instantly_freeze_a_bottle_of_sparkling_water.ogv\n\nhttps://commons.m.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Blue_rotating_brain_animation.mpg\n\nhttps://commons.m.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:7_Tesla_MRI_of_the_ex_vivo_human_brain_at_100_micron_resolution_(100_micron_MRI_acquired_FA25_coronal).webm\n\nhttps://commons.m.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Axonal_nerve_fibers_in_a_brain_-_the_neural_network_that_is_us.webm",

For this reason, we animated these vectors as orthogonal-ish. See: https://proceedings.mlr.press/v119/wang20k/wang20k.pdf\n\nPer Chenyang Yuan: at 10:15, the blurry image that results when removing random noise in DDPM is probably due to a mismatch in noise levels when calling the denoiser. When the denoiser is called on x_{t-1} during DDPM sampling, it is expected to have a certain noise level (let's call it sigma_{t-1}). If you generate x_{t-1} from x_t without adding noise, then the noise present in x_{t-1} is always smaller than sigma_{t-1}. This causes the denoiser to remove too much noise, thus pointing towards the mean of the dataset. \n\nThe text conditioning input to stable diffusion is not the 512-dim text embedding vector, but the output of the layer before that, [with dimension 77x512](https://stackoverflow.com/a/79243065)\n\nFor the vectors at 31:40 - Some implementations use f(x, t, cat) + alpha(f(x, t, cat) - f(x, t)), and some that do f(x, t) + alpha(f(x, t, cat) - f(x, t)), where an alpha value of 1 corresponds to no guidance. I chose the second format here to keep things simpler.\n\nAt 30:30, the unconditional t=1 vector field looks a bit different from what it did at the 17:15 mark. This is the result of different models trained for different parts of the video, and likely a result of different random initializations.\n\n\nPremium Beat Music ID: EEDYZ3FP44YX8OWT",

    "title": "Simulating and understanding phase change | Guest video by Vilas Winstein",
    "body": "Deriving the Boltzmann formula, defining temperature, and simulating liquid/vapor.\n@SpectralCollective has the second part: https://youtu.be/yEcysu5xZH0\nYou can play with a simulation of this model here: https://vilas.us/simulations/liquidvapor/\nThese lessons are funded directly by viewers: https://3b1b.co/support\nHome page: https://www.3blue1brown.com\n\nNotes from Vilas:\n1) This open problem is to prove the ergodicity of the deterministic dynamical systems that are used to model the molecule-level physics. A good example of such a dynamical system is the box with particles evolving according to Newton's laws with elastic collisions, like in the video.\n\n2) This video assumes that all probability distributions are discrete, which is the case in the simulations. But one can also set up this formalism for systems with continuous state spaces. Again, a good example is particles in a box, which are not restricted to a lattice, which is only used for visualization purposes in this video.\n\n3) Strictly speaking, these \"derivatives\" don't make sense since in our simulations the energy can only take on a discrete set of values. But a derivative is the right way to think about this, and is the correct notion in a limiting sense.\n\n4) The factor of -T in the definition of the chemical potential is sort of a historical leftover, but including it has the convenient side effect of allowing the same Boltzmann formula to hold, with an energy function that depends on the chemical potential as well. It should also be noted that temperature must equalize in any situation where the chemical potential equalizes, since it is impossible for systems to exchange molecules without also exchanging energy.\n\n5) This algorithm, where we only choose one pixel at a time, is called Glauber dynamics. There are multiple ways to parallelize it, but the method chosen in this video is to only update each pixel with a low probability at each call of the compute shader, to avoid (frequently) updating two neighboring pixels simultaneously. One could also alternate between updating the even or odd pixels at each step.\n\n6) By \"zooming out,\" what is meant, technically, is a renormalization operation whereby each 3x3 grid of pixels is replaced by just one pixel, which has a molecule exactly when 5 or more of the pixels in the 3x3 grid have molecules. But that is somewhat tough to simulate as the size has to increase by 9 at each step, so this video cheats a bit by just zooming out on a large simulation.\n\n7) The \"interesting behavior\" referenced here is the fact that the interface between the up and down sections of the picture can be rescaled (as the size of the model goes to infinity) in a way that yields a universal random curve called Schramm-Loewner evolution. This family of random curves shows up in many seemingly-unrelated places in statistical mechanics and probability.\n\nChapter markers:\n0:00 - What is phase change?\n6:27 - The Boltzmann law and free energy\n12:05 - A preliminary simulation\n15:30 - Defining temperature\n21:25 - Deriving the Boltzmann law\n24:30 - Sampling with MCMC\n28:30 - Chemical potential\n33:20 - Interesting properties\n\nThis video made use of the following Creative Commons material:\n\nhttps://commons.m.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:How_to_(nearly)_instantly_freeze_a_bottle_of_sparkling_water.ogv\n\nhttps://commons.m.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Blue_rotating_brain_animation.mpg\n\nhttps://commons.m.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:7_Tesla_MRI_of_the_ex_vivo_human_brain_at_100_micron_resolution_(100_micron_MRI_acquired_FA25_coronal).webm\n\nhttps://commons.m.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Axonal_nerve_fibers_in_a_brain_-_the_neural_network_that_is_us.webm",

For this reason, we animated these vectors as orthogonal-ish. See: https://proceedings.mlr.press/v119/wang20k/wang20k.pdf\n\nPer Chenyang Yuan: at 10:15, the blurry image that results when removing random noise in DDPM is probably due to a mismatch in noise levels when calling the denoiser. When the denoiser is called on x_{t-1} during DDPM sampling, it is expected to have a certain noise level (let's call it sigma_{t-1}). If you generate x_{t-1} from x_t without adding noise, then the noise present in x_{t-1} is always smaller than sigma_{t-1}. This causes the denoiser to remove too much noise, thus pointing towards the mean of the dataset. \n\nThe text conditioning input to stable diffusion is not the 512-dim text embedding vector, but the output of the layer before that, [with dimension 77x512](https://stackoverflow.com/a/79243065)\n\nFor the vectors at 31:40 - Some implementations use f(x, t, cat) + alpha(f(x, t, cat) - f(x, t)), and some that do f(x, t) + alpha(f(x, t, cat) - f(x, t)), where an alpha value of 1 corresponds to no guidance. I chose the second format here to keep things simpler.\n\nAt 30:30, the unconditional t=1 vector field looks a bit different from what it did at the 17:15 mark. This is the result of different models trained for different parts of the video, and likely a result of different random initializations.\n\n\nPremium Beat Music ID: EEDYZ3FP44YX8OWT",

    "title": "Simulating and understanding phase change | Guest video by Vilas Winstein",
    "body": "Deriving the Boltzmann formula, defining temperature, and simulating liquid/vapor.\n@SpectralCollective has the second part: https://youtu.be/yEcysu5xZH0\nYou can play with a simulation of this model here: https://vilas.us/simulations/liquidvapor/\nThese lessons are funded directly by viewers: https://3b1b.co/support\nHome page: https://www.3blue1brown.com\n\nNotes from Vilas:\n1) This open problem is to prove the ergodicity of the deterministic dynamical systems that are used to model the molecule-level physics. A good example of such a dynamical system is the box with particles evolving according to Newton's laws with elastic collisions, like in the video.\n\n2) This video assumes that all probability distributions are discrete, which is the case in the simulations. But one can also set up this formalism for systems with continuous state spaces. Again, a good example is particles in a box, which are not restricted to a lattice, which is only used for visualization purposes in this video.\n\n3) Strictly speaking, these \"derivatives\" don't make sense since in our simulations the energy can only take on a discrete set of values. But a derivative is the right way to think about this, and is the correct notion in a limiting sense.\n\n4) The factor of -T in the definition of the chemical potential is sort of a historical leftover, but including it has the convenient side effect of allowing the same Boltzmann formula to hold, with an energy function that depends on the chemical potential as well. It should also be noted that temperature must equalize in any situation where the chemical potential equalizes, since it is impossible for systems to exchange molecules without also exchanging energy.\n\n5) This algorithm, where we only choose one pixel at a time, is called Glauber dynamics. There are multiple ways to parallelize it, but the method chosen in this video is to only update each pixel with a low probability at each call of the compute shader, to avoid (frequently) updating two neighboring pixels simultaneously. One could also alternate between updating the even or odd pixels at each step.\n\n6) By \"zooming out,\" what is meant, technically, is a renormalization operation whereby each 3x3 grid of pixels is replaced by just one pixel, which has a molecule exactly when 5 or more of the pixels in the 3x3 grid have molecules. But that is somewhat tough to simulate as the size has to increase by 9 at each step, so this video cheats a bit by just zooming out on a large simulation.\n\n7) The \"interesting behavior\" referenced here is the fact that the interface between the up and down sections of the picture can be rescaled (as the size of the model goes to infinity) in a way that yields a universal random curve called Schramm-Loewner evolution. This family of random curves shows up in many seemingly-unrelated places in statistical mechanics and probability.\n\nChapter markers:\n0:00 - What is phase change?\n6:27 - The Boltzmann law and free energy\n12:05 - A preliminary simulation\n15:30 - Defining temperature\n21:25 - Deriving the Boltzmann law\n24:30 - Sampling with MCMC\n28:30 - Chemical potential\n33:20 - Interesting properties\n\nThis video made use of the following Creative Commons material:\n\nhttps://commons.m.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:How_to_(nearly)_instantly_freeze_a_bottle_of_sparkling_water.ogv\n\nhttps://commons.m.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Blue_rotating_brain_animation.mpg\n\nhttps://commons.m.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:7_Tesla_MRI_of_the_ex_vivo_human_brain_at_100_micron_resolution_(100_micron_MRI_acquired_FA25_coronal).webm\n\nhttps://commons.m.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Axonal_nerve_fibers_in_a_brain_-_the_neural_network_that_is_us.webm",

For this reason, we animated these vectors as orthogonal-ish. See: https://proceedings.mlr.press/v119/wang20k/wang20k.pdf\n\nPer Chenyang Yuan: at 10:15, the blurry image that results when removing random noise in DDPM is probably due to a mismatch in noise levels when calling the denoiser. When the denoiser is called on x_{t-1} during DDPM sampling, it is expected to have a certain noise level (let's call it sigma_{t-1}). If you generate x_{t-1} from x_t without adding noise, then the noise present in x_{t-1} is always smaller than sigma_{t-1}. This causes the denoiser to remove too much noise, thus pointing towards the mean of the dataset. \n\nThe text conditioning input to stable diffusion is not the 512-dim text embedding vector, but the output of the layer before that, [with dimension 77x512](https://stackoverflow.com/a/79243065)\n\nFor the vectors at 31:40 - Some implementations use f(x, t, cat) + alpha(f(x, t, cat) - f(x, t)), and some that do f(x, t) + alpha(f(x, t, cat) - f(x, t)), where an alpha value of 1 corresponds to no guidance. I chose the second format here to keep things simpler.\n\nAt 30:30, the unconditional t=1 vector field looks a bit different from what it did at the 17:15 mark. This is the result of different models trained for different parts of the video, and likely a result of different random initializations.\n\n\nPremium Beat Music ID: EEDYZ3FP44YX8OWT",

    "body": "<p>ServiceRadar is an open-source platform for distributed, secure network management and observability, scaling to 100k+ devices. Born from frustration with complex traditional NMS tools like Zabbix, it bridges legacy (SNMP/syslog) and modern (gNMI, OTLP) protocols for cloud-native environments.<p>We built ServiceRadar to simplify monitoring hybrid telecom networks, evolving it into a Kubernetes-native solution with Helm and Docker support. It uses mTLS with SPIFFE/SPIRE, NATS JetStream for event streaming (90M+ EPS), and SRQL for intuitive queries. Integrated with OpenTelemetry, Prometheus, and CloudEvents, it fills the network visibility gap in CNCF’s application-focused observability stack.<p>We’re seeking early adopters to try our demo or deploy locally—no sign-up needed. Feedback on usability or contributions for new protocols would be awesome.<p>Quick Start: helm install serviceradar carverauto/serviceradar or docker compose up -d<p>GitHub: <a href=\"https://github.com/carverauto/serviceradar\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/carverauto/serviceradar</a> (please star!)<p>Docs: <a href=\"https://docs.serviceradar.cloud\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://docs.serviceradar.cloud</a><p>Join our Discord or use GitHub Issues to share thoughts.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45624186\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45624186</a></p>\n<p>Points: 33</p>\n<p># Comments: 1</p>",

    "body": "Deriving the Boltzmann formula, defining temperature, and simulating liquid/vapor.\n@SpectralCollective has the second part: https://youtu.be/yEcysu5xZH0\nYou can play with a simulation of this model here: https://vilas.us/simulations/liquidvapor/\nThese lessons are funded directly by viewers: https://3b1b.co/support\nHome page: https://www.3blue1brown.com\n\nNotes from Vilas:\n1) This open problem is to prove the ergodicity of the deterministic dynamical systems that are used to model the molecule-level physics. A good example of such a dynamical system is the box with particles evolving according to Newton's laws with elastic collisions, like in the video.\n\n2) This video assumes that all probability distributions are discrete, which is the case in the simulations. But one can also set up this formalism for systems with continuous state spaces. Again, a good example is particles in a box, which are not restricted to a lattice, which is only used for visualization purposes in this video.\n\n3) Strictly speaking, these \"derivatives\" don't make sense since in our simulations the energy can only take on a discrete set of values. But a derivative is the right way to think about this, and is the correct notion in a limiting sense.\n\n4) The factor of -T in the definition of the chemical potential is sort of a historical leftover, but including it has the convenient side effect of allowing the same Boltzmann formula to hold, with an energy function that depends on the chemical potential as well. It should also be noted that temperature must equalize in any situation where the chemical potential equalizes, since it is impossible for systems to exchange molecules without also exchanging energy.\n\n5) This algorithm, where we only choose one pixel at a time, is called Glauber dynamics. There are multiple ways to parallelize it, but the method chosen in this video is to only update each pixel with a low probability at each call of the compute shader, to avoid (frequently) updating two neighboring pixels simultaneously. One could also alternate between updating the even or odd pixels at each step.\n\n6) By \"zooming out,\" what is meant, technically, is a renormalization operation whereby each 3x3 grid of pixels is replaced by just one pixel, which has a molecule exactly when 5 or more of the pixels in the 3x3 grid have molecules. But that is somewhat tough to simulate as the size has to increase by 9 at each step, so this video cheats a bit by just zooming out on a large simulation.\n\n7) The \"interesting behavior\" referenced here is the fact that the interface between the up and down sections of the picture can be rescaled (as the size of the model goes to infinity) in a way that yields a universal random curve called Schramm-Loewner evolution. This family of random curves shows up in many seemingly-unrelated places in statistical mechanics and probability.\n\nChapter markers:\n0:00 - What is phase change?\n6:27 - The Boltzmann law and free energy\n12:05 - A preliminary simulation\n15:30 - Defining temperature\n21:25 - Deriving the Boltzmann law\n24:30 - Sampling with MCMC\n28:30 - Chemical potential\n33:20 - Interesting properties\n\nThis video made use of the following Creative Commons material:\n\nhttps://commons.m.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:How_to_(nearly)_instantly_freeze_a_bottle_of_sparkling_water.ogv\n\nhttps://commons.m.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Blue_rotating_brain_animation.mpg\n\nhttps://commons.m.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:7_Tesla_MRI_of_the_ex_vivo_human_brain_at_100_micron_resolution_(100_micron_MRI_acquired_FA25_coronal).webm\n\nhttps://commons.m.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Axonal_nerve_fibers_in_a_brain_-_the_neural_network_that_is_us.webm",

For this reason, we animated these vectors as orthogonal-ish. See: https://proceedings.mlr.press/v119/wang20k/wang20k.pdf\n\nPer Chenyang Yuan: at 10:15, the blurry image that results when removing random noise in DDPM is probably due to a mismatch in noise levels when calling the denoiser. When the denoiser is called on x_{t-1} during DDPM sampling, it is expected to have a certain noise level (let's call it sigma_{t-1}). If you generate x_{t-1} from x_t without adding noise, then the noise present in x_{t-1} is always smaller than sigma_{t-1}. This causes the denoiser to remove too much noise, thus pointing towards the mean of the dataset. \n\nThe text conditioning input to stable diffusion is not the 512-dim text embedding vector, but the output of the layer before that, [with dimension 77x512](https://stackoverflow.com/a/79243065)\n\nFor the vectors at 31:40 - Some implementations use f(x, t, cat) + alpha(f(x, t, cat) - f(x, t)), and some that do f(x, t) + alpha(f(x, t, cat) - f(x, t)), where an alpha value of 1 corresponds to no guidance. I chose the second format here to keep things simpler.\n\nAt 30:30, the unconditional t=1 vector field looks a bit different from what it did at the 17:15 mark. This is the result of different models trained for different parts of the video, and likely a result of different random initializations.\n\n\nPremium Beat Music ID: EEDYZ3FP44YX8OWT",

    "body": "Deriving the Boltzmann formula, defining temperature, and simulating liquid/vapor.\n@SpectralCollective has the second part: https://youtu.be/yEcysu5xZH0\nYou can play with a simulation of this model here: https://vilas.us/simulations/liquidvapor/\nThese lessons are funded directly by viewers: https://3b1b.co/support\nHome page: https://www.3blue1brown.com\n\nNotes from Vilas:\n1) This open problem is to prove the ergodicity of the deterministic dynamical systems that are used to model the molecule-level physics. A good example of such a dynamical system is the box with particles evolving according to Newton's laws with elastic collisions, like in the video.\n\n2) This video assumes that all probability distributions are discrete, which is the case in the simulations. But one can also set up this formalism for systems with continuous state spaces. Again, a good example is particles in a box, which are not restricted to a lattice, which is only used for visualization purposes in this video.\n\n3) Strictly speaking, these \"derivatives\" don't make sense since in our simulations the energy can only take on a discrete set of values. But a derivative is the right way to think about this, and is the correct notion in a limiting sense.\n\n4) The factor of -T in the definition of the chemical potential is sort of a historical leftover, but including it has the convenient side effect of allowing the same Boltzmann formula to hold, with an energy function that depends on the chemical potential as well. It should also be noted that temperature must equalize in any situation where the chemical potential equalizes, since it is impossible for systems to exchange molecules without also exchanging energy.\n\n5) This algorithm, where we only choose one pixel at a time, is called Glauber dynamics. There are multiple ways to parallelize it, but the method chosen in this video is to only update each pixel with a low probability at each call of the compute shader, to avoid (frequently) updating two neighboring pixels simultaneously. One could also alternate between updating the even or odd pixels at each step.\n\n6) By \"zooming out,\" what is meant, technically, is a renormalization operation whereby each 3x3 grid of pixels is replaced by just one pixel, which has a molecule exactly when 5 or more of the pixels in the 3x3 grid have molecules. But that is somewhat tough to simulate as the size has to increase by 9 at each step, so this video cheats a bit by just zooming out on a large simulation.\n\n7) The \"interesting behavior\" referenced here is the fact that the interface between the up and down sections of the picture can be rescaled (as the size of the model goes to infinity) in a way that yields a universal random curve called Schramm-Loewner evolution. This family of random curves shows up in many seemingly-unrelated places in statistical mechanics and probability.\n\nChapter markers:\n0:00 - What is phase change?\n6:27 - The Boltzmann law and free energy\n12:05 - A preliminary simulation\n15:30 - Defining temperature\n21:25 - Deriving the Boltzmann law\n24:30 - Sampling with MCMC\n28:30 - Chemical potential\n33:20 - Interesting properties\n\nThis video made use of the following Creative Commons material:\n\nhttps://commons.m.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:How_to_(nearly)_instantly_freeze_a_bottle_of_sparkling_water.ogv\n\nhttps://commons.m.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Blue_rotating_brain_animation.mpg\n\nhttps://commons.m.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:7_Tesla_MRI_of_the_ex_vivo_human_brain_at_100_micron_resolution_(100_micron_MRI_acquired_FA25_coronal).webm\n\nhttps://commons.m.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Axonal_nerve_fibers_in_a_brain_-_the_neural_network_that_is_us.webm",

For this reason, we animated these vectors as orthogonal-ish. See: https://proceedings.mlr.press/v119/wang20k/wang20k.pdf\n\nPer Chenyang Yuan: at 10:15, the blurry image that results when removing random noise in DDPM is probably due to a mismatch in noise levels when calling the denoiser. When the denoiser is called on x_{t-1} during DDPM sampling, it is expected to have a certain noise level (let's call it sigma_{t-1}). If you generate x_{t-1} from x_t without adding noise, then the noise present in x_{t-1} is always smaller than sigma_{t-1}. This causes the denoiser to remove too much noise, thus pointing towards the mean of the dataset. \n\nThe text conditioning input to stable diffusion is not the 512-dim text embedding vector, but the output of the layer before that, [with dimension 77x512](https://stackoverflow.com/a/79243065)\n\nFor the vectors at 31:40 - Some implementations use f(x, t, cat) + alpha(f(x, t, cat) - f(x, t)), and some that do f(x, t) + alpha(f(x, t, cat) - f(x, t)), where an alpha value of 1 corresponds to no guidance. I chose the second format here to keep things simpler.\n\nAt 30:30, the unconditional t=1 vector field looks a bit different from what it did at the 17:15 mark. This is the result of different models trained for different parts of the video, and likely a result of different random initializations.\n\n\nPremium Beat Music ID: EEDYZ3FP44YX8OWT",

    "body": "Deriving the Boltzmann formula, defining temperature, and simulating liquid/vapor.\n@SpectralCollective has the second part: https://youtu.be/yEcysu5xZH0\nYou can play with a simulation of this model here: https://vilas.us/simulations/liquidvapor/\nThese lessons are funded directly by viewers: https://3b1b.co/support\nHome page: https://www.3blue1brown.com\n\nNotes from Vilas:\n1) This open problem is to prove the ergodicity of the deterministic dynamical systems that are used to model the molecule-level physics. A good example of such a dynamical system is the box with particles evolving according to Newton's laws with elastic collisions, like in the video.\n\n2) This video assumes that all probability distributions are discrete, which is the case in the simulations. But one can also set up this formalism for systems with continuous state spaces. Again, a good example is particles in a box, which are not restricted to a lattice, which is only used for visualization purposes in this video.\n\n3) Strictly speaking, these \"derivatives\" don't make sense since in our simulations the energy can only take on a discrete set of values. But a derivative is the right way to think about this, and is the correct notion in a limiting sense.\n\n4) The factor of -T in the definition of the chemical potential is sort of a historical leftover, but including it has the convenient side effect of allowing the same Boltzmann formula to hold, with an energy function that depends on the chemical potential as well. It should also be noted that temperature must equalize in any situation where the chemical potential equalizes, since it is impossible for systems to exchange molecules without also exchanging energy.\n\n5) This algorithm, where we only choose one pixel at a time, is called Glauber dynamics. There are multiple ways to parallelize it, but the method chosen in this video is to only update each pixel with a low probability at each call of the compute shader, to avoid (frequently) updating two neighboring pixels simultaneously. One could also alternate between updating the even or odd pixels at each step.\n\n6) By \"zooming out,\" what is meant, technically, is a renormalization operation whereby each 3x3 grid of pixels is replaced by just one pixel, which has a molecule exactly when 5 or more of the pixels in the 3x3 grid have molecules. But that is somewhat tough to simulate as the size has to increase by 9 at each step, so this video cheats a bit by just zooming out on a large simulation.\n\n7) The \"interesting behavior\" referenced here is the fact that the interface between the up and down sections of the picture can be rescaled (as the size of the model goes to infinity) in a way that yields a universal random curve called Schramm-Loewner evolution. This family of random curves shows up in many seemingly-unrelated places in statistical mechanics and probability.\n\nChapter markers:\n0:00 - What is phase change?\n6:27 - The Boltzmann law and free energy\n12:05 - A preliminary simulation\n15:30 - Defining temperature\n21:25 - Deriving the Boltzmann law\n24:30 - Sampling with MCMC\n28:30 - Chemical potential\n33:20 - Interesting properties\n\nThis video made use of the following Creative Commons material:\n\nhttps://commons.m.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:How_to_(nearly)_instantly_freeze_a_bottle_of_sparkling_water.ogv\n\nhttps://commons.m.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Blue_rotating_brain_animation.mpg\n\nhttps://commons.m.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:7_Tesla_MRI_of_the_ex_vivo_human_brain_at_100_micron_resolution_(100_micron_MRI_acquired_FA25_coronal).webm\n\nhttps://commons.m.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Axonal_nerve_fibers_in_a_brain_-_the_neural_network_that_is_us.webm",

For this reason, we animated these vectors as orthogonal-ish. See: https://proceedings.mlr.press/v119/wang20k/wang20k.pdf\n\nPer Chenyang Yuan: at 10:15, the blurry image that results when removing random noise in DDPM is probably due to a mismatch in noise levels when calling the denoiser. When the denoiser is called on x_{t-1} during DDPM sampling, it is expected to have a certain noise level (let's call it sigma_{t-1}). If you generate x_{t-1} from x_t without adding noise, then the noise present in x_{t-1} is always smaller than sigma_{t-1}. This causes the denoiser to remove too much noise, thus pointing towards the mean of the dataset. \n\nThe text conditioning input to stable diffusion is not the 512-dim text embedding vector, but the output of the layer before that, [with dimension 77x512](https://stackoverflow.com/a/79243065)\n\nFor the vectors at 31:40 - Some implementations use f(x, t, cat) + alpha(f(x, t, cat) - f(x, t)), and some that do f(x, t) + alpha(f(x, t, cat) - f(x, t)), where an alpha value of 1 corresponds to no guidance. I chose the second format here to keep things simpler.\n\nAt 30:30, the unconditional t=1 vector field looks a bit different from what it did at the 17:15 mark. This is the result of different models trained for different parts of the video, and likely a result of different random initializations.\n\n\nPremium Beat Music ID: EEDYZ3FP44YX8OWT",

    "body": "Qubits, state vectors, and Grover's algorithm for search.\nInstead of sponsored ad reads, these lessons are funded directly by viewers: https://3b1b.co/support\nAn equally valuable form of support is to share the videos.\n\nThe subtitles on this video were done using AI, and are likely imperfect, but they are open for community corrections at https://criblate.com/\n\nAdam Brown's paper on the connection between Grover's Algorithm and block collisions:\nhttps://arxiv.org/pdf/1912.02207\n\nIf you want to learn the relevant underlying quantum mechanics here, a very friendly resource is the course Mithuna at Looking Glass Universe is currently putting together. See, for instance, this explainer of a qubit:\nhttps://youtu.be/kgSVkVNxXyU\n\nIf you want to learn more about the fundamentals of quantum computing, my friends Michael Nielsen and Andy Matuschak put together this wonderful resource, aimed at ensuring long-term memory of core concepts:\nhttps://quantum.country/\n\nBBBV Theorem:\nhttps://www.scottaaronson.com/qclec/23.pdf\n\nTimestamps:\n0:00 - Misconceptions\n6:03 - The state vector\n12:00 - Qubits\n15:52 - The vibe of quantum algorithms\n18:38 - Grover’s Algorithm\n29:30 - Support pitch\n30:11 - Complex values\n31:27 - Why square root?\n34:01 - Connection to block collisions \n35:08 - Additional resources\n\n------------------\n\nThese animations are largely made using a custom Python library, manim.  See the FAQ comments here:\nhttps://3b1b.co/faq#manim\nhttps://github.com/3b1b/manim\nhttps://github.com/ManimCommunity/manim/\n\nAll code for specific videos is visible here:\nhttps://github.com/3b1b/videos/\n\nThe music is by Vincent Rubinetti.\nhttps://www.vincentrubinetti.com\nhttps://vincerubinetti.bandcamp.com/album/the-music-of-3blue1brown\nhttps://open.spotify.com/album/1dVyjwS8FBqXhRunaG5W5u\n\n------------------\n\n3blue1brown is a channel about animating math, in all senses of the word animate. If you're reading the bottom of a video description, I'm guessing you're more interested than the average viewer in lessons here.

    "body": "<p>ServiceRadar is an open-source platform for distributed, secure network management and observability, scaling to 100k+ devices. Born from frustration with complex traditional NMS tools like Zabbix, it bridges legacy (SNMP/syslog) and modern (gNMI, OTLP) protocols for cloud-native environments.<p>We built ServiceRadar to simplify monitoring hybrid telecom networks, evolving it into a Kubernetes-native solution with Helm and Docker support. It uses mTLS with SPIFFE/SPIRE, NATS JetStream for event streaming (90M+ EPS), and SRQL for intuitive queries. Integrated with OpenTelemetry, Prometheus, and CloudEvents, it fills the network visibility gap in CNCF’s application-focused observability stack.<p>We’re seeking early adopters to try our demo or deploy locally—no sign-up needed. Feedback on usability or contributions for new protocols would be awesome.<p>Quick Start: helm install serviceradar carverauto/serviceradar or docker compose up -d<p>GitHub: <a href=\"https://github.com/carverauto/serviceradar\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/carverauto/serviceradar</a> (please star!)<p>Docs: <a href=\"https://docs.serviceradar.cloud\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://docs.serviceradar.cloud</a><p>Join our Discord or use GitHub Issues to share thoughts.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45624186\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45624186</a></p>\n<p>Points: 33</p>\n<p># Comments: 1</p>",

    "title": "Simulating and understanding phase change | Guest video by Vilas Winstein",
    "body": "Deriving the Boltzmann formula, defining temperature, and simulating liquid/vapor.\n@SpectralCollective has the second part: https://youtu.be/yEcysu5xZH0\nYou can play with a simulation of this model here: https://vilas.us/simulations/liquidvapor/\nThese lessons are funded directly by viewers: https://3b1b.co/support\nHome page: https://www.3blue1brown.com\n\nNotes from Vilas:\n1) This open problem is to prove the ergodicity of the deterministic dynamical systems that are used to model the molecule-level physics. A good example of such a dynamical system is the box with particles evolving according to Newton's laws with elastic collisions, like in the video.\n\n2) This video assumes that all probability distributions are discrete, which is the case in the simulations. But one can also set up this formalism for systems with continuous state spaces. Again, a good example is particles in a box, which are not restricted to a lattice, which is only used for visualization purposes in this video.\n\n3) Strictly speaking, these \"derivatives\" don't make sense since in our simulations the energy can only take on a discrete set of values. But a derivative is the right way to think about this, and is the correct notion in a limiting sense.\n\n4) The factor of -T in the definition of the chemical potential is sort of a historical leftover, but including it has the convenient side effect of allowing the same Boltzmann formula to hold, with an energy function that depends on the chemical potential as well. It should also be noted that temperature must equalize in any situation where the chemical potential equalizes, since it is impossible for systems to exchange molecules without also exchanging energy.\n\n5) This algorithm, where we only choose one pixel at a time, is called Glauber dynamics. There are multiple ways to parallelize it, but the method chosen in this video is to only update each pixel with a low probability at each call of the compute shader, to avoid (frequently) updating two neighboring pixels simultaneously. One could also alternate between updating the even or odd pixels at each step.\n\n6) By \"zooming out,\" what is meant, technically, is a renormalization operation whereby each 3x3 grid of pixels is replaced by just one pixel, which has a molecule exactly when 5 or more of the pixels in the 3x3 grid have molecules. But that is somewhat tough to simulate as the size has to increase by 9 at each step, so this video cheats a bit by just zooming out on a large simulation.\n\n7) The \"interesting behavior\" referenced here is the fact that the interface between the up and down sections of the picture can be rescaled (as the size of the model goes to infinity) in a way that yields a universal random curve called Schramm-Loewner evolution. This family of random curves shows up in many seemingly-unrelated places in statistical mechanics and probability.\n\nChapter markers:\n0:00 - What is phase change?\n6:27 - The Boltzmann law and free energy\n12:05 - A preliminary simulation\n15:30 - Defining temperature\n21:25 - Deriving the Boltzmann law\n24:30 - Sampling with MCMC\n28:30 - Chemical potential\n33:20 - Interesting properties\n\nThis video made use of the following Creative Commons material:\n\nhttps://commons.m.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:How_to_(nearly)_instantly_freeze_a_bottle_of_sparkling_water.ogv\n\nhttps://commons.m.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Blue_rotating_brain_animation.mpg\n\nhttps://commons.m.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:7_Tesla_MRI_of_the_ex_vivo_human_brain_at_100_micron_resolution_(100_micron_MRI_acquired_FA25_coronal).webm\n\nhttps://commons.m.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Axonal_nerve_fibers_in_a_brain_-_the_neural_network_that_is_us.webm",

For this reason, we animated these vectors as orthogonal-ish. See: https://proceedings.mlr.press/v119/wang20k/wang20k.pdf\n\nPer Chenyang Yuan: at 10:15, the blurry image that results when removing random noise in DDPM is probably due to a mismatch in noise levels when calling the denoiser. When the denoiser is called on x_{t-1} during DDPM sampling, it is expected to have a certain noise level (let's call it sigma_{t-1}). If you generate x_{t-1} from x_t without adding noise, then the noise present in x_{t-1} is always smaller than sigma_{t-1}. This causes the denoiser to remove too much noise, thus pointing towards the mean of the dataset. \n\nThe text conditioning input to stable diffusion is not the 512-dim text embedding vector, but the output of the layer before that, [with dimension 77x512](https://stackoverflow.com/a/79243065)\n\nFor the vectors at 31:40 - Some implementations use f(x, t, cat) + alpha(f(x, t, cat) - f(x, t)), and some that do f(x, t) + alpha(f(x, t, cat) - f(x, t)), where an alpha value of 1 corresponds to no guidance. I chose the second format here to keep things simpler.\n\nAt 30:30, the unconditional t=1 vector field looks a bit different from what it did at the 17:15 mark. This is the result of different models trained for different parts of the video, and likely a result of different random initializations.\n\n\nPremium Beat Music ID: EEDYZ3FP44YX8OWT",

    "title": "Simulating and understanding phase change | Guest video by Vilas Winstein",
    "body": "Deriving the Boltzmann formula, defining temperature, and simulating liquid/vapor.\n@SpectralCollective has the second part: https://youtu.be/yEcysu5xZH0\nYou can play with a simulation of this model here: https://vilas.us/simulations/liquidvapor/\nThese lessons are funded directly by viewers: https://3b1b.co/support\nHome page: https://www.3blue1brown.com\n\nNotes from Vilas:\n1) This open problem is to prove the ergodicity of the deterministic dynamical systems that are used to model the molecule-level physics. A good example of such a dynamical system is the box with particles evolving according to Newton's laws with elastic collisions, like in the video.\n\n2) This video assumes that all probability distributions are discrete, which is the case in the simulations. But one can also set up this formalism for systems with continuous state spaces. Again, a good example is particles in a box, which are not restricted to a lattice, which is only used for visualization purposes in this video.\n\n3) Strictly speaking, these \"derivatives\" don't make sense since in our simulations the energy can only take on a discrete set of values. But a derivative is the right way to think about this, and is the correct notion in a limiting sense.\n\n4) The factor of -T in the definition of the chemical potential is sort of a historical leftover, but including it has the convenient side effect of allowing the same Boltzmann formula to hold, with an energy function that depends on the chemical potential as well. It should also be noted that temperature must equalize in any situation where the chemical potential equalizes, since it is impossible for systems to exchange molecules without also exchanging energy.\n\n5) This algorithm, where we only choose one pixel at a time, is called Glauber dynamics. There are multiple ways to parallelize it, but the method chosen in this video is to only update each pixel with a low probability at each call of the compute shader, to avoid (frequently) updating two neighboring pixels simultaneously. One could also alternate between updating the even or odd pixels at each step.\n\n6) By \"zooming out,\" what is meant, technically, is a renormalization operation whereby each 3x3 grid of pixels is replaced by just one pixel, which has a molecule exactly when 5 or more of the pixels in the 3x3 grid have molecules. But that is somewhat tough to simulate as the size has to increase by 9 at each step, so this video cheats a bit by just zooming out on a large simulation.\n\n7) The \"interesting behavior\" referenced here is the fact that the interface between the up and down sections of the picture can be rescaled (as the size of the model goes to infinity) in a way that yields a universal random curve called Schramm-Loewner evolution. This family of random curves shows up in many seemingly-unrelated places in statistical mechanics and probability.\n\nChapter markers:\n0:00 - What is phase change?\n6:27 - The Boltzmann law and free energy\n12:05 - A preliminary simulation\n15:30 - Defining temperature\n21:25 - Deriving the Boltzmann law\n24:30 - Sampling with MCMC\n28:30 - Chemical potential\n33:20 - Interesting properties\n\nThis video made use of the following Creative Commons material:\n\nhttps://commons.m.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:How_to_(nearly)_instantly_freeze_a_bottle_of_sparkling_water.ogv\n\nhttps://commons.m.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Blue_rotating_brain_animation.mpg\n\nhttps://commons.m.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:7_Tesla_MRI_of_the_ex_vivo_human_brain_at_100_micron_resolution_(100_micron_MRI_acquired_FA25_coronal).webm\n\nhttps://commons.m.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Axonal_nerve_fibers_in_a_brain_-_the_neural_network_that_is_us.webm",

For this reason, we animated these vectors as orthogonal-ish. See: https://proceedings.mlr.press/v119/wang20k/wang20k.pdf\n\nPer Chenyang Yuan: at 10:15, the blurry image that results when removing random noise in DDPM is probably due to a mismatch in noise levels when calling the denoiser. When the denoiser is called on x_{t-1} during DDPM sampling, it is expected to have a certain noise level (let's call it sigma_{t-1}). If you generate x_{t-1} from x_t without adding noise, then the noise present in x_{t-1} is always smaller than sigma_{t-1}. This causes the denoiser to remove too much noise, thus pointing towards the mean of the dataset. \n\nThe text conditioning input to stable diffusion is not the 512-dim text embedding vector, but the output of the layer before that, [with dimension 77x512](https://stackoverflow.com/a/79243065)\n\nFor the vectors at 31:40 - Some implementations use f(x, t, cat) + alpha(f(x, t, cat) - f(x, t)), and some that do f(x, t) + alpha(f(x, t, cat) - f(x, t)), where an alpha value of 1 corresponds to no guidance. I chose the second format here to keep things simpler.\n\nAt 30:30, the unconditional t=1 vector field looks a bit different from what it did at the 17:15 mark. This is the result of different models trained for different parts of the video, and likely a result of different random initializations.\n\n\nPremium Beat Music ID: EEDYZ3FP44YX8OWT",

    "body": "Deriving the Boltzmann formula, defining temperature, and simulating liquid/vapor.\n@SpectralCollective has the second part: https://youtu.be/yEcysu5xZH0\nYou can play with a simulation of this model here: https://vilas.us/simulations/liquidvapor/\nThese lessons are funded directly by viewers: https://3b1b.co/support\nHome page: https://www.3blue1brown.com\n\nNotes from Vilas:\n1) This open problem is to prove the ergodicity of the deterministic dynamical systems that are used to model the molecule-level physics. A good example of such a dynamical system is the box with particles evolving according to Newton's laws with elastic collisions, like in the video.\n\n2) This video assumes that all probability distributions are discrete, which is the case in the simulations. But one can also set up this formalism for systems with continuous state spaces. Again, a good example is particles in a box, which are not restricted to a lattice, which is only used for visualization purposes in this video.\n\n3) Strictly speaking, these \"derivatives\" don't make sense since in our simulations the energy can only take on a discrete set of values. But a derivative is the right way to think about this, and is the correct notion in a limiting sense.\n\n4) The factor of -T in the definition of the chemical potential is sort of a historical leftover, but including it has the convenient side effect of allowing the same Boltzmann formula to hold, with an energy function that depends on the chemical potential as well. It should also be noted that temperature must equalize in any situation where the chemical potential equalizes, since it is impossible for systems to exchange molecules without also exchanging energy.\n\n5) This algorithm, where we only choose one pixel at a time, is called Glauber dynamics. There are multiple ways to parallelize it, but the method chosen in this video is to only update each pixel with a low probability at each call of the compute shader, to avoid (frequently) updating two neighboring pixels simultaneously. One could also alternate between updating the even or odd pixels at each step.\n\n6) By \"zooming out,\" what is meant, technically, is a renormalization operation whereby each 3x3 grid of pixels is replaced by just one pixel, which has a molecule exactly when 5 or more of the pixels in the 3x3 grid have molecules. But that is somewhat tough to simulate as the size has to increase by 9 at each step, so this video cheats a bit by just zooming out on a large simulation.\n\n7) The \"interesting behavior\" referenced here is the fact that the interface between the up and down sections of the picture can be rescaled (as the size of the model goes to infinity) in a way that yields a universal random curve called Schramm-Loewner evolution. This family of random curves shows up in many seemingly-unrelated places in statistical mechanics and probability.\n\nChapter markers:\n0:00 - What is phase change?\n6:27 - The Boltzmann law and free energy\n12:05 - A preliminary simulation\n15:30 - Defining temperature\n21:25 - Deriving the Boltzmann law\n24:30 - Sampling with MCMC\n28:30 - Chemical potential\n33:20 - Interesting properties\n\nThis video made use of the following Creative Commons material:\n\nhttps://commons.m.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:How_to_(nearly)_instantly_freeze_a_bottle_of_sparkling_water.ogv\n\nhttps://commons.m.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Blue_rotating_brain_animation.mpg\n\nhttps://commons.m.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:7_Tesla_MRI_of_the_ex_vivo_human_brain_at_100_micron_resolution_(100_micron_MRI_acquired_FA25_coronal).webm\n\nhttps://commons.m.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Axonal_nerve_fibers_in_a_brain_-_the_neural_network_that_is_us.webm",

For this reason, we animated these vectors as orthogonal-ish. See: https://proceedings.mlr.press/v119/wang20k/wang20k.pdf\n\nPer Chenyang Yuan: at 10:15, the blurry image that results when removing random noise in DDPM is probably due to a mismatch in noise levels when calling the denoiser. When the denoiser is called on x_{t-1} during DDPM sampling, it is expected to have a certain noise level (let's call it sigma_{t-1}). If you generate x_{t-1} from x_t without adding noise, then the noise present in x_{t-1} is always smaller than sigma_{t-1}. This causes the denoiser to remove too much noise, thus pointing towards the mean of the dataset. \n\nThe text conditioning input to stable diffusion is not the 512-dim text embedding vector, but the output of the layer before that, [with dimension 77x512](https://stackoverflow.com/a/79243065)\n\nFor the vectors at 31:40 - Some implementations use f(x, t, cat) + alpha(f(x, t, cat) - f(x, t)), and some that do f(x, t) + alpha(f(x, t, cat) - f(x, t)), where an alpha value of 1 corresponds to no guidance. I chose the second format here to keep things simpler.\n\nAt 30:30, the unconditional t=1 vector field looks a bit different from what it did at the 17:15 mark. This is the result of different models trained for different parts of the video, and likely a result of different random initializations.\n\n\nPremium Beat Music ID: EEDYZ3FP44YX8OWT",

    "body": "<p>ServiceRadar is an open-source platform for distributed, secure network management and observability, scaling to 100k+ devices. Born from frustration with complex traditional NMS tools like Zabbix, it bridges legacy (SNMP/syslog) and modern (gNMI, OTLP) protocols for cloud-native environments.<p>We built ServiceRadar to simplify monitoring hybrid telecom networks, evolving it into a Kubernetes-native solution with Helm and Docker support. It uses mTLS with SPIFFE/SPIRE, NATS JetStream for event streaming (90M+ EPS), and SRQL for intuitive queries. Integrated with OpenTelemetry, Prometheus, and CloudEvents, it fills the network visibility gap in CNCF’s application-focused observability stack.<p>We’re seeking early adopters to try our demo or deploy locally—no sign-up needed. Feedback on usability or contributions for new protocols would be awesome.<p>Quick Start: helm install serviceradar carverauto/serviceradar or docker compose up -d<p>GitHub: <a href=\"https://github.com/carverauto/serviceradar\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/carverauto/serviceradar</a> (please star!)<p>Docs: <a href=\"https://docs.serviceradar.cloud\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://docs.serviceradar.cloud</a><p>Join our Discord or use GitHub Issues to share thoughts.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45624186\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45624186</a></p>\n<p>Points: 33</p>\n<p># Comments: 1</p>",

    "body": "Deriving the Boltzmann formula, defining temperature, and simulating liquid/vapor.\n@SpectralCollective has the second part: https://youtu.be/yEcysu5xZH0\nYou can play with a simulation of this model here: https://vilas.us/simulations/liquidvapor/\nThese lessons are funded directly by viewers: https://3b1b.co/support\nHome page: https://www.3blue1brown.com\n\nNotes from Vilas:\n1) This open problem is to prove the ergodicity of the deterministic dynamical systems that are used to model the molecule-level physics. A good example of such a dynamical system is the box with particles evolving according to Newton's laws with elastic collisions, like in the video.\n\n2) This video assumes that all probability distributions are discrete, which is the case in the simulations. But one can also set up this formalism for systems with continuous state spaces. Again, a good example is particles in a box, which are not restricted to a lattice, which is only used for visualization purposes in this video.\n\n3) Strictly speaking, these \"derivatives\" don't make sense since in our simulations the energy can only take on a discrete set of values. But a derivative is the right way to think about this, and is the correct notion in a limiting sense.\n\n4) The factor of -T in the definition of the chemical potential is sort of a historical leftover, but including it has the convenient side effect of allowing the same Boltzmann formula to hold, with an energy function that depends on the chemical potential as well. It should also be noted that temperature must equalize in any situation where the chemical potential equalizes, since it is impossible for systems to exchange molecules without also exchanging energy.\n\n5) This algorithm, where we only choose one pixel at a time, is called Glauber dynamics. There are multiple ways to parallelize it, but the method chosen in this video is to only update each pixel with a low probability at each call of the compute shader, to avoid (frequently) updating two neighboring pixels simultaneously. One could also alternate between updating the even or odd pixels at each step.\n\n6) By \"zooming out,\" what is meant, technically, is a renormalization operation whereby each 3x3 grid of pixels is replaced by just one pixel, which has a molecule exactly when 5 or more of the pixels in the 3x3 grid have molecules. But that is somewhat tough to simulate as the size has to increase by 9 at each step, so this video cheats a bit by just zooming out on a large simulation.\n\n7) The \"interesting behavior\" referenced here is the fact that the interface between the up and down sections of the picture can be rescaled (as the size of the model goes to infinity) in a way that yields a universal random curve called Schramm-Loewner evolution. This family of random curves shows up in many seemingly-unrelated places in statistical mechanics and probability.\n\nChapter markers:\n0:00 - What is phase change?\n6:27 - The Boltzmann law and free energy\n12:05 - A preliminary simulation\n15:30 - Defining temperature\n21:25 - Deriving the Boltzmann law\n24:30 - Sampling with MCMC\n28:30 - Chemical potential\n33:20 - Interesting properties\n\nThis video made use of the following Creative Commons material:\n\nhttps://commons.m.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:How_to_(nearly)_instantly_freeze_a_bottle_of_sparkling_water.ogv\n\nhttps://commons.m.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Blue_rotating_brain_animation.mpg\n\nhttps://commons.m.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:7_Tesla_MRI_of_the_ex_vivo_human_brain_at_100_micron_resolution_(100_micron_MRI_acquired_FA25_coronal).webm\n\nhttps://commons.m.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Axonal_nerve_fibers_in_a_brain_-_the_neural_network_that_is_us.webm",

For this reason, we animated these vectors as orthogonal-ish. See: https://proceedings.mlr.press/v119/wang20k/wang20k.pdf\n\nPer Chenyang Yuan: at 10:15, the blurry image that results when removing random noise in DDPM is probably due to a mismatch in noise levels when calling the denoiser. When the denoiser is called on x_{t-1} during DDPM sampling, it is expected to have a certain noise level (let's call it sigma_{t-1}). If you generate x_{t-1} from x_t without adding noise, then the noise present in x_{t-1} is always smaller than sigma_{t-1}. This causes the denoiser to remove too much noise, thus pointing towards the mean of the dataset. \n\nThe text conditioning input to stable diffusion is not the 512-dim text embedding vector, but the output of the layer before that, [with dimension 77x512](https://stackoverflow.com/a/79243065)\n\nFor the vectors at 31:40 - Some implementations use f(x, t, cat) + alpha(f(x, t, cat) - f(x, t)), and some that do f(x, t) + alpha(f(x, t, cat) - f(x, t)), where an alpha value of 1 corresponds to no guidance. I chose the second format here to keep things simpler.\n\nAt 30:30, the unconditional t=1 vector field looks a bit different from what it did at the 17:15 mark. This is the result of different models trained for different parts of the video, and likely a result of different random initializations.\n\n\nPremium Beat Music ID: EEDYZ3FP44YX8OWT",

    "title": "Simulating and understanding phase change | Guest video by Vilas Winstein",
    "body": "Deriving the Boltzmann formula, defining temperature, and simulating liquid/vapor.\n@SpectralCollective has the second part: https://youtu.be/yEcysu5xZH0\nYou can play with a simulation of this model here: https://vilas.us/simulations/liquidvapor/\nThese lessons are funded directly by viewers: https://3b1b.co/support\nHome page: https://www.3blue1brown.com\n\nNotes from Vilas:\n1) This open problem is to prove the ergodicity of the deterministic dynamical systems that are used to model the molecule-level physics. A good example of such a dynamical system is the box with particles evolving according to Newton's laws with elastic collisions, like in the video.\n\n2) This video assumes that all probability distributions are discrete, which is the case in the simulations. But one can also set up this formalism for systems with continuous state spaces. Again, a good example is particles in a box, which are not restricted to a lattice, which is only used for visualization purposes in this video.\n\n3) Strictly speaking, these \"derivatives\" don't make sense since in our simulations the energy can only take on a discrete set of values. But a derivative is the right way to think about this, and is the correct notion in a limiting sense.\n\n4) The factor of -T in the definition of the chemical potential is sort of a historical leftover, but including it has the convenient side effect of allowing the same Boltzmann formula to hold, with an energy function that depends on the chemical potential as well. It should also be noted that temperature must equalize in any situation where the chemical potential equalizes, since it is impossible for systems to exchange molecules without also exchanging energy.\n\n5) This algorithm, where we only choose one pixel at a time, is called Glauber dynamics. There are multiple ways to parallelize it, but the method chosen in this video is to only update each pixel with a low probability at each call of the compute shader, to avoid (frequently) updating two neighboring pixels simultaneously. One could also alternate between updating the even or odd pixels at each step.\n\n6) By \"zooming out,\" what is meant, technically, is a renormalization operation whereby each 3x3 grid of pixels is replaced by just one pixel, which has a molecule exactly when 5 or more of the pixels in the 3x3 grid have molecules. But that is somewhat tough to simulate as the size has to increase by 9 at each step, so this video cheats a bit by just zooming out on a large simulation.\n\n7) The \"interesting behavior\" referenced here is the fact that the interface between the up and down sections of the picture can be rescaled (as the size of the model goes to infinity) in a way that yields a universal random curve called Schramm-Loewner evolution. This family of random curves shows up in many seemingly-unrelated places in statistical mechanics and probability.\n\nChapter markers:\n0:00 - What is phase change?\n6:27 - The Boltzmann law and free energy\n12:05 - A preliminary simulation\n15:30 - Defining temperature\n21:25 - Deriving the Boltzmann law\n24:30 - Sampling with MCMC\n28:30 - Chemical potential\n33:20 - Interesting properties\n\nThis video made use of the following Creative Commons material:\n\nhttps://commons.m.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:How_to_(nearly)_instantly_freeze_a_bottle_of_sparkling_water.ogv\n\nhttps://commons.m.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Blue_rotating_brain_animation.mpg\n\nhttps://commons.m.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:7_Tesla_MRI_of_the_ex_vivo_human_brain_at_100_micron_resolution_(100_micron_MRI_acquired_FA25_coronal).webm\n\nhttps://commons.m.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Axonal_nerve_fibers_in_a_brain_-_the_neural_network_that_is_us.webm",

For this reason, we animated these vectors as orthogonal-ish. See: https://proceedings.mlr.press/v119/wang20k/wang20k.pdf\n\nPer Chenyang Yuan: at 10:15, the blurry image that results when removing random noise in DDPM is probably due to a mismatch in noise levels when calling the denoiser. When the denoiser is called on x_{t-1} during DDPM sampling, it is expected to have a certain noise level (let's call it sigma_{t-1}). If you generate x_{t-1} from x_t without adding noise, then the noise present in x_{t-1} is always smaller than sigma_{t-1}. This causes the denoiser to remove too much noise, thus pointing towards the mean of the dataset. \n\nThe text conditioning input to stable diffusion is not the 512-dim text embedding vector, but the output of the layer before that, [with dimension 77x512](https://stackoverflow.com/a/79243065)\n\nFor the vectors at 31:40 - Some implementations use f(x, t, cat) + alpha(f(x, t, cat) - f(x, t)), and some that do f(x, t) + alpha(f(x, t, cat) - f(x, t)), where an alpha value of 1 corresponds to no guidance. I chose the second format here to keep things simpler.\n\nAt 30:30, the unconditional t=1 vector field looks a bit different from what it did at the 17:15 mark. This is the result of different models trained for different parts of the video, and likely a result of different random initializations.\n\n\nPremium Beat Music ID: EEDYZ3FP44YX8OWT",

    "body": "Deriving the Boltzmann formula, defining temperature, and simulating liquid/vapor.\n@SpectralCollective has the second part: https://youtu.be/yEcysu5xZH0\nYou can play with a simulation of this model here: https://vilas.us/simulations/liquidvapor/\nThese lessons are funded directly by viewers: https://3b1b.co/support\nHome page: https://www.3blue1brown.com\n\nNotes from Vilas:\n1) This open problem is to prove the ergodicity of the deterministic dynamical systems that are used to model the molecule-level physics. A good example of such a dynamical system is the box with particles evolving according to Newton's laws with elastic collisions, like in the video.\n\n2) This video assumes that all probability distributions are discrete, which is the case in the simulations. But one can also set up this formalism for systems with continuous state spaces. Again, a good example is particles in a box, which are not restricted to a lattice, which is only used for visualization purposes in this video.\n\n3) Strictly speaking, these \"derivatives\" don't make sense since in our simulations the energy can only take on a discrete set of values. But a derivative is the right way to think about this, and is the correct notion in a limiting sense.\n\n4) The factor of -T in the definition of the chemical potential is sort of a historical leftover, but including it has the convenient side effect of allowing the same Boltzmann formula to hold, with an energy function that depends on the chemical potential as well. It should also be noted that temperature must equalize in any situation where the chemical potential equalizes, since it is impossible for systems to exchange molecules without also exchanging energy.\n\n5) This algorithm, where we only choose one pixel at a time, is called Glauber dynamics. There are multiple ways to parallelize it, but the method chosen in this video is to only update each pixel with a low probability at each call of the compute shader, to avoid (frequently) updating two neighboring pixels simultaneously. One could also alternate between updating the even or odd pixels at each step.\n\n6) By \"zooming out,\" what is meant, technically, is a renormalization operation whereby each 3x3 grid of pixels is replaced by just one pixel, which has a molecule exactly when 5 or more of the pixels in the 3x3 grid have molecules. But that is somewhat tough to simulate as the size has to increase by 9 at each step, so this video cheats a bit by just zooming out on a large simulation.\n\n7) The \"interesting behavior\" referenced here is the fact that the interface between the up and down sections of the picture can be rescaled (as the size of the model goes to infinity) in a way that yields a universal random curve called Schramm-Loewner evolution. This family of random curves shows up in many seemingly-unrelated places in statistical mechanics and probability.\n\nChapter markers:\n0:00 - What is phase change?\n6:27 - The Boltzmann law and free energy\n12:05 - A preliminary simulation\n15:30 - Defining temperature\n21:25 - Deriving the Boltzmann law\n24:30 - Sampling with MCMC\n28:30 - Chemical potential\n33:20 - Interesting properties\n\nThis video made use of the following Creative Commons material:\n\nhttps://commons.m.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:How_to_(nearly)_instantly_freeze_a_bottle_of_sparkling_water.ogv\n\nhttps://commons.m.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Blue_rotating_brain_animation.mpg\n\nhttps://commons.m.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:7_Tesla_MRI_of_the_ex_vivo_human_brain_at_100_micron_resolution_(100_micron_MRI_acquired_FA25_coronal).webm\n\nhttps://commons.m.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Axonal_nerve_fibers_in_a_brain_-_the_neural_network_that_is_us.webm",

For this reason, we animated these vectors as orthogonal-ish. See: https://proceedings.mlr.press/v119/wang20k/wang20k.pdf\n\nPer Chenyang Yuan: at 10:15, the blurry image that results when removing random noise in DDPM is probably due to a mismatch in noise levels when calling the denoiser. When the denoiser is called on x_{t-1} during DDPM sampling, it is expected to have a certain noise level (let's call it sigma_{t-1}). If you generate x_{t-1} from x_t without adding noise, then the noise present in x_{t-1} is always smaller than sigma_{t-1}. This causes the denoiser to remove too much noise, thus pointing towards the mean of the dataset. \n\nThe text conditioning input to stable diffusion is not the 512-dim text embedding vector, but the output of the layer before that, [with dimension 77x512](https://stackoverflow.com/a/79243065)\n\nFor the vectors at 31:40 - Some implementations use f(x, t, cat) + alpha(f(x, t, cat) - f(x, t)), and some that do f(x, t) + alpha(f(x, t, cat) - f(x, t)), where an alpha value of 1 corresponds to no guidance. I chose the second format here to keep things simpler.\n\nAt 30:30, the unconditional t=1 vector field looks a bit different from what it did at the 17:15 mark. This is the result of different models trained for different parts of the video, and likely a result of different random initializations.\n\n\nPremium Beat Music ID: EEDYZ3FP44YX8OWT",

    "body": "<p>ServiceRadar is an open-source platform for distributed, secure network management and observability, scaling to 100k+ devices. Born from frustration with complex traditional NMS tools like Zabbix, it bridges legacy (SNMP/syslog) and modern (gNMI, OTLP) protocols for cloud-native environments.<p>We built ServiceRadar to simplify monitoring hybrid telecom networks, evolving it into a Kubernetes-native solution with Helm and Docker support. It uses mTLS with SPIFFE/SPIRE, NATS JetStream for event streaming (90M+ EPS), and SRQL for intuitive queries. Integrated with OpenTelemetry, Prometheus, and CloudEvents, it fills the network visibility gap in CNCF’s application-focused observability stack.<p>We’re seeking early adopters to try our demo or deploy locally—no sign-up needed. Feedback on usability or contributions for new protocols would be awesome.<p>Quick Start: helm install serviceradar carverauto/serviceradar or docker compose up -d<p>GitHub: <a href=\"https://github.com/carverauto/serviceradar\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/carverauto/serviceradar</a> (please star!)<p>Docs: <a href=\"https://docs.serviceradar.cloud\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://docs.serviceradar.cloud</a><p>Join our Discord or use GitHub Issues to share thoughts.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45624186\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45624186</a></p>\n<p>Points: 33</p>\n<p># Comments: 1</p>",

    "body": "Deriving the Boltzmann formula, defining temperature, and simulating liquid/vapor.\n@SpectralCollective has the second part: https://youtu.be/yEcysu5xZH0\nYou can play with a simulation of this model here: https://vilas.us/simulations/liquidvapor/\nThese lessons are funded directly by viewers: https://3b1b.co/support\nHome page: https://www.3blue1brown.com\n\nNotes from Vilas:\n1) This open problem is to prove the ergodicity of the deterministic dynamical systems that are used to model the molecule-level physics. A good example of such a dynamical system is the box with particles evolving according to Newton's laws with elastic collisions, like in the video.\n\n2) This video assumes that all probability distributions are discrete, which is the case in the simulations. But one can also set up this formalism for systems with continuous state spaces. Again, a good example is particles in a box, which are not restricted to a lattice, which is only used for visualization purposes in this video.\n\n3) Strictly speaking, these \"derivatives\" don't make sense since in our simulations the energy can only take on a discrete set of values. But a derivative is the right way to think about this, and is the correct notion in a limiting sense.\n\n4) The factor of -T in the definition of the chemical potential is sort of a historical leftover, but including it has the convenient side effect of allowing the same Boltzmann formula to hold, with an energy function that depends on the chemical potential as well. It should also be noted that temperature must equalize in any situation where the chemical potential equalizes, since it is impossible for systems to exchange molecules without also exchanging energy.\n\n5) This algorithm, where we only choose one pixel at a time, is called Glauber dynamics. There are multiple ways to parallelize it, but the method chosen in this video is to only update each pixel with a low probability at each call of the compute shader, to avoid (frequently) updating two neighboring pixels simultaneously. One could also alternate between updating the even or odd pixels at each step.\n\n6) By \"zooming out,\" what is meant, technically, is a renormalization operation whereby each 3x3 grid of pixels is replaced by just one pixel, which has a molecule exactly when 5 or more of the pixels in the 3x3 grid have molecules. But that is somewhat tough to simulate as the size has to increase by 9 at each step, so this video cheats a bit by just zooming out on a large simulation.\n\n7) The \"interesting behavior\" referenced here is the fact that the interface between the up and down sections of the picture can be rescaled (as the size of the model goes to infinity) in a way that yields a universal random curve called Schramm-Loewner evolution. This family of random curves shows up in many seemingly-unrelated places in statistical mechanics and probability.\n\nChapter markers:\n0:00 - What is phase change?\n6:27 - The Boltzmann law and free energy\n12:05 - A preliminary simulation\n15:30 - Defining temperature\n21:25 - Deriving the Boltzmann law\n24:30 - Sampling with MCMC\n28:30 - Chemical potential\n33:20 - Interesting properties\n\nThis video made use of the following Creative Commons material:\n\nhttps://commons.m.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:How_to_(nearly)_instantly_freeze_a_bottle_of_sparkling_water.ogv\n\nhttps://commons.m.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Blue_rotating_brain_animation.mpg\n\nhttps://commons.m.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:7_Tesla_MRI_of_the_ex_vivo_human_brain_at_100_micron_resolution_(100_micron_MRI_acquired_FA25_coronal).webm\n\nhttps://commons.m.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Axonal_nerve_fibers_in_a_brain_-_the_neural_network_that_is_us.webm",

For this reason, we animated these vectors as orthogonal-ish. See: https://proceedings.mlr.press/v119/wang20k/wang20k.pdf\n\nPer Chenyang Yuan: at 10:15, the blurry image that results when removing random noise in DDPM is probably due to a mismatch in noise levels when calling the denoiser. When the denoiser is called on x_{t-1} during DDPM sampling, it is expected to have a certain noise level (let's call it sigma_{t-1}). If you generate x_{t-1} from x_t without adding noise, then the noise present in x_{t-1} is always smaller than sigma_{t-1}. This causes the denoiser to remove too much noise, thus pointing towards the mean of the dataset. \n\nThe text conditioning input to stable diffusion is not the 512-dim text embedding vector, but the output of the layer before that, [with dimension 77x512](https://stackoverflow.com/a/79243065)\n\nFor the vectors at 31:40 - Some implementations use f(x, t, cat) + alpha(f(x, t, cat) - f(x, t)), and some that do f(x, t) + alpha(f(x, t, cat) - f(x, t)), where an alpha value of 1 corresponds to no guidance. I chose the second format here to keep things simpler.\n\nAt 30:30, the unconditional t=1 vector field looks a bit different from what it did at the 17:15 mark. This is the result of different models trained for different parts of the video, and likely a result of different random initializations.\n\n\nPremium Beat Music ID: EEDYZ3FP44YX8OWT",

    "title": "Simulating and understanding phase change | Guest video by Vilas Winstein",
    "body": "Deriving the Boltzmann formula, defining temperature, and simulating liquid/vapor.\n@SpectralCollective has the second part: https://youtu.be/yEcysu5xZH0\nYou can play with a simulation of this model here: https://vilas.us/simulations/liquidvapor/\nThese lessons are funded directly by viewers: https://3b1b.co/support\nHome page: https://www.3blue1brown.com\n\nNotes from Vilas:\n1) This open problem is to prove the ergodicity of the deterministic dynamical systems that are used to model the molecule-level physics. A good example of such a dynamical system is the box with particles evolving according to Newton's laws with elastic collisions, like in the video.\n\n2) This video assumes that all probability distributions are discrete, which is the case in the simulations. But one can also set up this formalism for systems with continuous state spaces. Again, a good example is particles in a box, which are not restricted to a lattice, which is only used for visualization purposes in this video.\n\n3) Strictly speaking, these \"derivatives\" don't make sense since in our simulations the energy can only take on a discrete set of values. But a derivative is the right way to think about this, and is the correct notion in a limiting sense.\n\n4) The factor of -T in the definition of the chemical potential is sort of a historical leftover, but including it has the convenient side effect of allowing the same Boltzmann formula to hold, with an energy function that depends on the chemical potential as well. It should also be noted that temperature must equalize in any situation where the chemical potential equalizes, since it is impossible for systems to exchange molecules without also exchanging energy.\n\n5) This algorithm, where we only choose one pixel at a time, is called Glauber dynamics. There are multiple ways to parallelize it, but the method chosen in this video is to only update each pixel with a low probability at each call of the compute shader, to avoid (frequently) updating two neighboring pixels simultaneously. One could also alternate between updating the even or odd pixels at each step.\n\n6) By \"zooming out,\" what is meant, technically, is a renormalization operation whereby each 3x3 grid of pixels is replaced by just one pixel, which has a molecule exactly when 5 or more of the pixels in the 3x3 grid have molecules. But that is somewhat tough to simulate as the size has to increase by 9 at each step, so this video cheats a bit by just zooming out on a large simulation.\n\n7) The \"interesting behavior\" referenced here is the fact that the interface between the up and down sections of the picture can be rescaled (as the size of the model goes to infinity) in a way that yields a universal random curve called Schramm-Loewner evolution. This family of random curves shows up in many seemingly-unrelated places in statistical mechanics and probability.\n\nChapter markers:\n0:00 - What is phase change?\n6:27 - The Boltzmann law and free energy\n12:05 - A preliminary simulation\n15:30 - Defining temperature\n21:25 - Deriving the Boltzmann law\n24:30 - Sampling with MCMC\n28:30 - Chemical potential\n33:20 - Interesting properties\n\nThis video made use of the following Creative Commons material:\n\nhttps://commons.m.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:How_to_(nearly)_instantly_freeze_a_bottle_of_sparkling_water.ogv\n\nhttps://commons.m.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Blue_rotating_brain_animation.mpg\n\nhttps://commons.m.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:7_Tesla_MRI_of_the_ex_vivo_human_brain_at_100_micron_resolution_(100_micron_MRI_acquired_FA25_coronal).webm\n\nhttps://commons.m.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Axonal_nerve_fibers_in_a_brain_-_the_neural_network_that_is_us.webm",

For this reason, we animated these vectors as orthogonal-ish. See: https://proceedings.mlr.press/v119/wang20k/wang20k.pdf\n\nPer Chenyang Yuan: at 10:15, the blurry image that results when removing random noise in DDPM is probably due to a mismatch in noise levels when calling the denoiser. When the denoiser is called on x_{t-1} during DDPM sampling, it is expected to have a certain noise level (let's call it sigma_{t-1}). If you generate x_{t-1} from x_t without adding noise, then the noise present in x_{t-1} is always smaller than sigma_{t-1}. This causes the denoiser to remove too much noise, thus pointing towards the mean of the dataset. \n\nThe text conditioning input to stable diffusion is not the 512-dim text embedding vector, but the output of the layer before that, [with dimension 77x512](https://stackoverflow.com/a/79243065)\n\nFor the vectors at 31:40 - Some implementations use f(x, t, cat) + alpha(f(x, t, cat) - f(x, t)), and some that do f(x, t) + alpha(f(x, t, cat) - f(x, t)), where an alpha value of 1 corresponds to no guidance. I chose the second format here to keep things simpler.\n\nAt 30:30, the unconditional t=1 vector field looks a bit different from what it did at the 17:15 mark. This is the result of different models trained for different parts of the video, and likely a result of different random initializations.\n\n\nPremium Beat Music ID: EEDYZ3FP44YX8OWT",

    "body": "Deriving the Boltzmann formula, defining temperature, and simulating liquid/vapor.\n@SpectralCollective has the second part: https://youtu.be/yEcysu5xZH0\nYou can play with a simulation of this model here: https://vilas.us/simulations/liquidvapor/\nThese lessons are funded directly by viewers: https://3b1b.co/support\nHome page: https://www.3blue1brown.com\n\nNotes from Vilas:\n1) This open problem is to prove the ergodicity of the deterministic dynamical systems that are used to model the molecule-level physics. A good example of such a dynamical system is the box with particles evolving according to Newton's laws with elastic collisions, like in the video.\n\n2) This video assumes that all probability distributions are discrete, which is the case in the simulations. But one can also set up this formalism for systems with continuous state spaces. Again, a good example is particles in a box, which are not restricted to a lattice, which is only used for visualization purposes in this video.\n\n3) Strictly speaking, these \"derivatives\" don't make sense since in our simulations the energy can only take on a discrete set of values. But a derivative is the right way to think about this, and is the correct notion in a limiting sense.\n\n4) The factor of -T in the definition of the chemical potential is sort of a historical leftover, but including it has the convenient side effect of allowing the same Boltzmann formula to hold, with an energy function that depends on the chemical potential as well. It should also be noted that temperature must equalize in any situation where the chemical potential equalizes, since it is impossible for systems to exchange molecules without also exchanging energy.\n\n5) This algorithm, where we only choose one pixel at a time, is called Glauber dynamics. There are multiple ways to parallelize it, but the method chosen in this video is to only update each pixel with a low probability at each call of the compute shader, to avoid (frequently) updating two neighboring pixels simultaneously. One could also alternate between updating the even or odd pixels at each step.\n\n6) By \"zooming out,\" what is meant, technically, is a renormalization operation whereby each 3x3 grid of pixels is replaced by just one pixel, which has a molecule exactly when 5 or more of the pixels in the 3x3 grid have molecules. But that is somewhat tough to simulate as the size has to increase by 9 at each step, so this video cheats a bit by just zooming out on a large simulation.\n\n7) The \"interesting behavior\" referenced here is the fact that the interface between the up and down sections of the picture can be rescaled (as the size of the model goes to infinity) in a way that yields a universal random curve called Schramm-Loewner evolution. This family of random curves shows up in many seemingly-unrelated places in statistical mechanics and probability.\n\nChapter markers:\n0:00 - What is phase change?\n6:27 - The Boltzmann law and free energy\n12:05 - A preliminary simulation\n15:30 - Defining temperature\n21:25 - Deriving the Boltzmann law\n24:30 - Sampling with MCMC\n28:30 - Chemical potential\n33:20 - Interesting properties\n\nThis video made use of the following Creative Commons material:\n\nhttps://commons.m.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:How_to_(nearly)_instantly_freeze_a_bottle_of_sparkling_water.ogv\n\nhttps://commons.m.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Blue_rotating_brain_animation.mpg\n\nhttps://commons.m.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:7_Tesla_MRI_of_the_ex_vivo_human_brain_at_100_micron_resolution_(100_micron_MRI_acquired_FA25_coronal).webm\n\nhttps://commons.m.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Axonal_nerve_fibers_in_a_brain_-_the_neural_network_that_is_us.webm",

For this reason, we animated these vectors as orthogonal-ish. See: https://proceedings.mlr.press/v119/wang20k/wang20k.pdf\n\nPer Chenyang Yuan: at 10:15, the blurry image that results when removing random noise in DDPM is probably due to a mismatch in noise levels when calling the denoiser. When the denoiser is called on x_{t-1} during DDPM sampling, it is expected to have a certain noise level (let's call it sigma_{t-1}). If you generate x_{t-1} from x_t without adding noise, then the noise present in x_{t-1} is always smaller than sigma_{t-1}. This causes the denoiser to remove too much noise, thus pointing towards the mean of the dataset. \n\nThe text conditioning input to stable diffusion is not the 512-dim text embedding vector, but the output of the layer before that, [with dimension 77x512](https://stackoverflow.com/a/79243065)\n\nFor the vectors at 31:40 - Some implementations use f(x, t, cat) + alpha(f(x, t, cat) - f(x, t)), and some that do f(x, t) + alpha(f(x, t, cat) - f(x, t)), where an alpha value of 1 corresponds to no guidance. I chose the second format here to keep things simpler.\n\nAt 30:30, the unconditional t=1 vector field looks a bit different from what it did at the 17:15 mark. This is the result of different models trained for different parts of the video, and likely a result of different random initializations.\n\n\nPremium Beat Music ID: EEDYZ3FP44YX8OWT",

    "title": "Show HN: ServiceRadar – open-source Network Observability Platform",
    "body": "<p>ServiceRadar is an open-source platform for distributed, secure network management and observability, scaling to 100k+ devices. Born from frustration with complex traditional NMS tools like Zabbix, it bridges legacy (SNMP/syslog) and modern (gNMI, OTLP) protocols for cloud-native environments.<p>We built ServiceRadar to simplify monitoring hybrid telecom networks, evolving it into a Kubernetes-native solution with Helm and Docker support. It uses mTLS with SPIFFE/SPIRE, NATS JetStream for event streaming (90M+ EPS), and SRQL for intuitive queries. Integrated with OpenTelemetry, Prometheus, and CloudEvents, it fills the network visibility gap in CNCF’s application-focused observability stack.<p>We’re seeking early adopters to try our demo or deploy locally—no sign-up needed. Feedback on usability or contributions for new protocols would be awesome.<p>Quick Start: helm install serviceradar carverauto/serviceradar or docker compose up -d<p>GitHub: <a href=\"https://github.com/carverauto/serviceradar\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/carverauto/serviceradar</a> (please star!)<p>Docs: <a href=\"https://docs.serviceradar.cloud\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://docs.serviceradar.cloud</a><p>Join our Discord or use GitHub Issues to share thoughts.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45624186\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45624186</a></p>\n<p>Points: 33</p>\n<p># Comments: 1</p>",

    "body": "Deriving the Boltzmann formula, defining temperature, and simulating liquid/vapor.\n@SpectralCollective has the second part: https://youtu.be/yEcysu5xZH0\nYou can play with a simulation of this model here: https://vilas.us/simulations/liquidvapor/\nThese lessons are funded directly by viewers: https://3b1b.co/support\nHome page: https://www.3blue1brown.com\n\nNotes from Vilas:\n1) This open problem is to prove the ergodicity of the deterministic dynamical systems that are used to model the molecule-level physics. A good example of such a dynamical system is the box with particles evolving according to Newton's laws with elastic collisions, like in the video.\n\n2) This video assumes that all probability distributions are discrete, which is the case in the simulations. But one can also set up this formalism for systems with continuous state spaces. Again, a good example is particles in a box, which are not restricted to a lattice, which is only used for visualization purposes in this video.\n\n3) Strictly speaking, these \"derivatives\" don't make sense since in our simulations the energy can only take on a discrete set of values. But a derivative is the right way to think about this, and is the correct notion in a limiting sense.\n\n4) The factor of -T in the definition of the chemical potential is sort of a historical leftover, but including it has the convenient side effect of allowing the same Boltzmann formula to hold, with an energy function that depends on the chemical potential as well. It should also be noted that temperature must equalize in any situation where the chemical potential equalizes, since it is impossible for systems to exchange molecules without also exchanging energy.\n\n5) This algorithm, where we only choose one pixel at a time, is called Glauber dynamics. There are multiple ways to parallelize it, but the method chosen in this video is to only update each pixel with a low probability at each call of the compute shader, to avoid (frequently) updating two neighboring pixels simultaneously. One could also alternate between updating the even or odd pixels at each step.\n\n6) By \"zooming out,\" what is meant, technically, is a renormalization operation whereby each 3x3 grid of pixels is replaced by just one pixel, which has a molecule exactly when 5 or more of the pixels in the 3x3 grid have molecules. But that is somewhat tough to simulate as the size has to increase by 9 at each step, so this video cheats a bit by just zooming out on a large simulation.\n\n7) The \"interesting behavior\" referenced here is the fact that the interface between the up and down sections of the picture can be rescaled (as the size of the model goes to infinity) in a way that yields a universal random curve called Schramm-Loewner evolution. This family of random curves shows up in many seemingly-unrelated places in statistical mechanics and probability.\n\nChapter markers:\n0:00 - What is phase change?\n6:27 - The Boltzmann law and free energy\n12:05 - A preliminary simulation\n15:30 - Defining temperature\n21:25 - Deriving the Boltzmann law\n24:30 - Sampling with MCMC\n28:30 - Chemical potential\n33:20 - Interesting properties\n\nThis video made use of the following Creative Commons material:\n\nhttps://commons.m.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:How_to_(nearly)_instantly_freeze_a_bottle_of_sparkling_water.ogv\n\nhttps://commons.m.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Blue_rotating_brain_animation.mpg\n\nhttps://commons.m.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:7_Tesla_MRI_of_the_ex_vivo_human_brain_at_100_micron_resolution_(100_micron_MRI_acquired_FA25_coronal).webm\n\nhttps://commons.m.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Axonal_nerve_fibers_in_a_brain_-_the_neural_network_that_is_us.webm",

For this reason, we animated these vectors as orthogonal-ish. See: https://proceedings.mlr.press/v119/wang20k/wang20k.pdf\n\nPer Chenyang Yuan: at 10:15, the blurry image that results when removing random noise in DDPM is probably due to a mismatch in noise levels when calling the denoiser. When the denoiser is called on x_{t-1} during DDPM sampling, it is expected to have a certain noise level (let's call it sigma_{t-1}). If you generate x_{t-1} from x_t without adding noise, then the noise present in x_{t-1} is always smaller than sigma_{t-1}. This causes the denoiser to remove too much noise, thus pointing towards the mean of the dataset. \n\nThe text conditioning input to stable diffusion is not the 512-dim text embedding vector, but the output of the layer before that, [with dimension 77x512](https://stackoverflow.com/a/79243065)\n\nFor the vectors at 31:40 - Some implementations use f(x, t, cat) + alpha(f(x, t, cat) - f(x, t)), and some that do f(x, t) + alpha(f(x, t, cat) - f(x, t)), where an alpha value of 1 corresponds to no guidance. I chose the second format here to keep things simpler.\n\nAt 30:30, the unconditional t=1 vector field looks a bit different from what it did at the 17:15 mark. This is the result of different models trained for different parts of the video, and likely a result of different random initializations.\n\n\nPremium Beat Music ID: EEDYZ3FP44YX8OWT",

    "title": "Simulating and understanding phase change | Guest video by Vilas Winstein",
    "body": "Deriving the Boltzmann formula, defining temperature, and simulating liquid/vapor.\n@SpectralCollective has the second part: https://youtu.be/yEcysu5xZH0\nYou can play with a simulation of this model here: https://vilas.us/simulations/liquidvapor/\nThese lessons are funded directly by viewers: https://3b1b.co/support\nHome page: https://www.3blue1brown.com\n\nNotes from Vilas:\n1) This open problem is to prove the ergodicity of the deterministic dynamical systems that are used to model the molecule-level physics. A good example of such a dynamical system is the box with particles evolving according to Newton's laws with elastic collisions, like in the video.\n\n2) This video assumes that all probability distributions are discrete, which is the case in the simulations. But one can also set up this formalism for systems with continuous state spaces. Again, a good example is particles in a box, which are not restricted to a lattice, which is only used for visualization purposes in this video.\n\n3) Strictly speaking, these \"derivatives\" don't make sense since in our simulations the energy can only take on a discrete set of values. But a derivative is the right way to think about this, and is the correct notion in a limiting sense.\n\n4) The factor of -T in the definition of the chemical potential is sort of a historical leftover, but including it has the convenient side effect of allowing the same Boltzmann formula to hold, with an energy function that depends on the chemical potential as well. It should also be noted that temperature must equalize in any situation where the chemical potential equalizes, since it is impossible for systems to exchange molecules without also exchanging energy.\n\n5) This algorithm, where we only choose one pixel at a time, is called Glauber dynamics. There are multiple ways to parallelize it, but the method chosen in this video is to only update each pixel with a low probability at each call of the compute shader, to avoid (frequently) updating two neighboring pixels simultaneously. One could also alternate between updating the even or odd pixels at each step.\n\n6) By \"zooming out,\" what is meant, technically, is a renormalization operation whereby each 3x3 grid of pixels is replaced by just one pixel, which has a molecule exactly when 5 or more of the pixels in the 3x3 grid have molecules. But that is somewhat tough to simulate as the size has to increase by 9 at each step, so this video cheats a bit by just zooming out on a large simulation.\n\n7) The \"interesting behavior\" referenced here is the fact that the interface between the up and down sections of the picture can be rescaled (as the size of the model goes to infinity) in a way that yields a universal random curve called Schramm-Loewner evolution. This family of random curves shows up in many seemingly-unrelated places in statistical mechanics and probability.\n\nChapter markers:\n0:00 - What is phase change?\n6:27 - The Boltzmann law and free energy\n12:05 - A preliminary simulation\n15:30 - Defining temperature\n21:25 - Deriving the Boltzmann law\n24:30 - Sampling with MCMC\n28:30 - Chemical potential\n33:20 - Interesting properties\n\nThis video made use of the following Creative Commons material:\n\nhttps://commons.m.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:How_to_(nearly)_instantly_freeze_a_bottle_of_sparkling_water.ogv\n\nhttps://commons.m.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Blue_rotating_brain_animation.mpg\n\nhttps://commons.m.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:7_Tesla_MRI_of_the_ex_vivo_human_brain_at_100_micron_resolution_(100_micron_MRI_acquired_FA25_coronal).webm\n\nhttps://commons.m.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Axonal_nerve_fibers_in_a_brain_-_the_neural_network_that_is_us.webm",

For this reason, we animated these vectors as orthogonal-ish. See: https://proceedings.mlr.press/v119/wang20k/wang20k.pdf\n\nPer Chenyang Yuan: at 10:15, the blurry image that results when removing random noise in DDPM is probably due to a mismatch in noise levels when calling the denoiser. When the denoiser is called on x_{t-1} during DDPM sampling, it is expected to have a certain noise level (let's call it sigma_{t-1}). If you generate x_{t-1} from x_t without adding noise, then the noise present in x_{t-1} is always smaller than sigma_{t-1}. This causes the denoiser to remove too much noise, thus pointing towards the mean of the dataset. \n\nThe text conditioning input to stable diffusion is not the 512-dim text embedding vector, but the output of the layer before that, [with dimension 77x512](https://stackoverflow.com/a/79243065)\n\nFor the vectors at 31:40 - Some implementations use f(x, t, cat) + alpha(f(x, t, cat) - f(x, t)), and some that do f(x, t) + alpha(f(x, t, cat) - f(x, t)), where an alpha value of 1 corresponds to no guidance. I chose the second format here to keep things simpler.\n\nAt 30:30, the unconditional t=1 vector field looks a bit different from what it did at the 17:15 mark. This is the result of different models trained for different parts of the video, and likely a result of different random initializations.\n\n\nPremium Beat Music ID: EEDYZ3FP44YX8OWT",
