The move is intended to reduce the risk of collisions, putting the satellites in a region that&#39;s <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/theres-no-easy-answer-to-being-a-space-janitor-170011469.html\" data-i13n=\"cpos:2;pos:1\">less cluttered</a> and will allow them to deorbit more quickly should an incident occur.&nbsp;</p><p>&quot;Lowering the satellites results in condensing Starlink orbits, and will increase space safety in several ways,&quot; Nicolls wrote, also pointing to the coming solar minimum — a period in the sun&#39;s 11ish-year cycle when activity is lower — as one of the reasons for the move. The next solar minimum is expected to occur in the early 2030s. &quot;As solar minimum approaches, atmospheric density decreases which means the ballistic decay time at any given altitude increases - lowering will mean a &gt;80% reduction in ballistic decay time in solar minimum, or 4+ years reduced to a few months,&quot; Nicolls wrote.</p><figure><img src=\"https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/Screenshot_2026-01-01_at_9.48.02%E2%80%AFPM.jpg\" data-crop-orig-src=\"https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/Screenshot_2026-01-01_at_9.48.02%E2%80%AFPM.jpg\" style=\"height:1398px;width:1296px;\" alt=\"A screenshot of the X post by Starlink VP of engineering Michael Nicolls \" data-uuid=\"dba03a94-e10d-4521-a7eb-a02873d74bc1\"/><figcaption>A screenshot of an X post by Starlink VP of engineering Michael Nicolls announcing that satellites orbiting at around 500 kilometers will be lowered to 480km</figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\"></div></figure><p>The announcement comes a few weeks after Starlink said one of its satellites had <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/science/space/a-starlink-satellite-just-exploded-and-left-trackable-debris-120002814.html\" data-i13n=\"cpos:3;pos:1\">experienced an anomaly</a> that created some debris and sent it tumbling.

The company announced a new model, the Freestyle+, ahead of CES, touting twice the brightness of its predecessor at 430 ISO lumens, and AI-powered screen optimization features. As with Freestyles past, the Freestyle+ offers 180-degree rotation and 360-degree audio. This one also supports Q-Symphony so it&#39;ll work with some Samsung soundbars. Samsung hasn&#39;t revealed much else in the way of specs or pricing, but it&#39;ll be showing off the Freestyle+ at CES 2026, so we&#39;re likely to learn more details soon.&nbsp;</p><p>While previous iterations of Samsung&#39;s compact projector offered automatic screen adjustment features, like auto focus and auto leveling, the Freestyle+ uses AI to take optimization a step further. With AI OptiScreen, as the company is calling it, the projector offers 3D auto keystone to fix distortion on uneven or non-flat surfaces, real-time focus when the projector is moved, automatic screen fit for compatible accessories and wall calibration to reduce visual distractions from the projection surface.

Ahead of the business&#39; upcoming appearance at CES, we&#39;ve learned a bit about what Airloom has accomplished this year and what it is aiming for next.</p><p>Rather than the very tall towers typically used for this approach, Airloom&#39;s structures are 20 to 30 meters high. They are comprised of a loop of adjustable wings that move along a track, a design that’s akin to a roller coaster. As the wings move, they generate power just like the blades on a regular wind turbine do. Airloom claims that its structures require 40 percent less mass than a traditional one while delivering the same output. It also says the Airloom&#39;s towers require 42 percent fewer parts and 96 percent fewer unique parts. In combination, the company says its approach is 85 percent faster to deploy and 47 percent less expensive than horizontal axis wind turbines. Airloom broke ground on a pilot site in June for testing out its approach and confirming how those figures work in practice. </p><p>It’s not feasible to bring a wind farm, even a small one, into CES, but Airloom will have a booth at the event with materials about its technology and engineering. While the business isn&#39;t in a consumer-facing field, the impact of Airloom&#39;s work could have a future positive impact on people if the data center boom continues.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/science/airloom-will-showcase-its-new-approach-to-wind-power-at-ces-160000063.html?src=rss",

    "title": "In 2025, quitting social media felt easier than ever",
    "body": "<p>For a tech writer, being very offline is sort of like being a marathon coach who doesn’t run. So in 2025, I tried to reverse years of studied avoidance towards the most ubiquitous technological phenomenon on earth —  I got back on social media. The change was short-lived.&nbsp;</p><p>My first exodus from the feeds took some work — disabling notifications, removing apps from my homescreen and then deleting accounts entirely. This time, the phone put itself down. The whole thing has simply lost its luster.</p><p>I started with Instagram. Every experience went like this: I’d see a single post from one of the rare family members or IRL friends who are active on the platform. Next, I was fed a sponsored post, followed by suggestions to follow randos. After that, a series of influencer videos that, admittedly, appeal to my taste (funny/absurdist women and dissertations on urban planning). That was followed up with more sponsored posts, mostly from brands I’d looked up for work. Then it’d circle back to the influencers. My eyes glazed over and I tossed the phone aside.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Years back, the platform gave off a jolt of quasi-social connection that I’d spend hours sucking up. I fed on pointless thoughts from an ex-coworker, vacation reels from a college roommate, a half-baked loaf of bread that an old friend dropped on the floor but took a picture of anyway. Now it’s a bare sliver of that stuff, shoehorned between towers of sponsored content and posts from people who make or promote their living on Instagram. The real people have left. The connection is gone. The FOMO is no more.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>I experienced some variation of the same disappointment on every platform I rejoined. When I got back on TikTok a few months <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/social-media/tiktok-is-back-in-apples-app-store-in-the-us-014013369.html\" data-i13n=\"cpos:1;pos:1\">after the ban</a>, it felt like a frenzied shopping mall. Every video seems to be about four seconds long and most are promotional and/or shoppable. YouTube Shorts is drowning in AI-generated videos, and I don’t hit up social media to watch fake footage of desperate wild animal babies clambering onto the boats of helpful humans. My life has no need for simulated toddlers admonishing their pets. Occasionally, I’d hit on something compelling: a clip from late night TV, a stupidly decadent dessert recipe, people from other countries explaining cultural subtleties.&nbsp;</p><p>But for me, these social media platforms are no longer velcro for the eyes. I remember losing focus, spending long hours on YouTube Shorts and IG. I’d look up bleary-eyed and shame-faced after hours scrolling TikTok’s For You Page. Now, after a few minutes, a bored ickiness sets in. I feel like I’m trapped in a carnival of bots hawking shampoo at me and I just want to go home.&nbsp;</p><p>It’s not a mystery how or why things feel different; The answer is always money. These billion- and trillion-dollar companies have shareholders who prize year-over-year performance over anything else. So we get more sponsored posts on Instagram.

The fact that I can’t connect with my fellow common people using their services is not surprising. The change isn’t even driving everyone away. Instagram reported more users than ever this year, to the tune of <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/social-media/instagram-reaches-3-billion-monthly-users-160554420.html\" data-i13n=\"cpos:11;pos:1\">35 percent of the planet</a>. Billions of users still scroll TikTok and watch YouTube Shorts. So maybe it’s just a me thing.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>And I have options. Over-monetization may have made me not want to engage with a few social media behemoths, but things aren’t so dire everywhere. Bluesky reminds me of Twitter before X. I take comfort in seeing posts that prove most people are as dismayed as I am over a government and wider economic system that are nakedly uninterested in serving the public. The hot takes aren’t quite as funny as they were on Twitter years back — maybe it’s just all been said before or perhaps things have gotten too dire for levity. I still don’t end up spending a lot of time on the platform, however. It’s not as weird as it was before <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/social-media/bluesky-surges-to-15-million-users-after-getting-a-million-sign-ups-in-one-week-224213573.html\" data-i13n=\"cpos:12;pos:1\">the defection</a> and I get tired of the stream of news headlines contextualized with tut-tutting and handwringing — I’m perfectly capable of doing that myself.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>It’d be easy to say that social media just isn’t my thing, but that’s not true because I can’t quit Reddit — the shining exception to my social media ennui. It feels filled with actual people. Ads exist, but in a subdued, manageable way. And every contributor, commenter and moderator I’ve come across on the app is militantly vigilant against the onslaught of artificially generated content. I also like the organizational structure. I know my Home tab will only expose me to my chosen subs and I derive great joy from happy cows, greeble-chasing cats, enigmatic night feelings and freaky abandoned spaces. I use my local subreddit r/Albuquerque daily to answer questions and keep tabs on the world (directly) around me.&nbsp;</p><p>Sadly, Reddit is an outlier, a misfit exception to the rule, and now that it’s gone <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/reddit-is-now-a-publicly-traded-company-144455403.html\" data-i13n=\"cpos:13;pos:1\">public</a>, it may follow a <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/social-media/reddit-puts-its-plans-for-paid-subreddits-on-hold-181455933.html\" data-i13n=\"cpos:14;pos:1\">similar monetization</a> push. Bluesky is tiny, new and not <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.pcmag.com/news/bluesky-figuring-out-how-to-make-money-without-spamming-you-with-ads\" data-i13n=\"cpos:15;pos:1\">yet profitable</a>, so who knows where its financial journey will lead it (though the “<a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"\" class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/bluesky-made-more-money-selling-160957010.html\" data-i13n=\"cpos:16;pos:1\">world without Caesars</a>” shirt gives us some hope).&nbsp;</p><p>There’s something lamentable about the loss of the connections we gleaned from platforms that were once compelling, engrossing and rife with the creativity of our fellow humans. Ultimately, any public-facing company that prioritizes profits over everything else has no incentive to look out for its users. So I don’t expect any of the larger social platforms to pull back on their monetization marches. For now, I’ve decided I’m comfortable with my admittedly narrow interaction with the world of social media. As a Gen-Xer, online-first wasn’t how my relationship to the world started out. And I’m pretty confident I know enough about other tech-related stuff to be useful to my editors and readers without a black belt in social.

These devices log details like body fat, muscle mass and water levels, then sync everything to your phone so you can see patterns instead of guessing. It is an easy way to track changes and stay motivated between workouts or check-ins with your doctor.<br><br>Some smart scales keep things simple and focus on just your data, while others tie into big fitness platforms or support multiple users under one roof.

If you’re looking to alter your body shape, that figure could go up as your waistline goes down since muscle weighs more than fat.</p> <span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span>\n<p>Some scales go further by providing additional metrics like visceral fat levels, giving you a more comprehensive picture of your health. Dr. Anne Swift, Director of Public Health teaching at the University of Cambridge, said “weighing yourself too often can result in [you] becoming fixated on small fluctuations day-to-day rather than the overall trend over time.” Swift added “it’s sometimes better to focus on how clothes fit, or how you feel, rather than your weight.”</p> \n<p>A meta-analysis from <a data-i13n=\"cpos:6;pos:1\" href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26742706/\">2016</a> found there may be some negative psychological impact from self weighing. A <a data-i13n=\"cpos:7;pos:1\" href=\"https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/circ.138.suppl_1.10962\">2018 study</a>, however, said there may be a positive correlation between regular weigh-ins and accelerated weight loss. It can be a minefield and I’d urge you to take real care of yourself and remember success won’t happen overnight.</p> \n<h2 id=\"jump-link-best-smart-scales-for-2026\">Best smart scales for 2026</h2> \n<p>\n <core-commerce id=\"55f3e395d8e045399b07c9d7af9846d2\" data-type=\"product-list\" data-original-url=\"https://www.amazon.com/Fitbit-FB203BK-Bluetooth-Digital-Weight/dp/B07VV6GKDS\"></core-commerce></p> \n<p>\n <core-commerce id=\"a5989e4ee75340c09e62ebcccf292e40\" data-type=\"product-list\" data-original-url=\"https://www.amazon.com/eufy-Intelligent-Bluetooth-16-Measurement-Multi-Modes/dp/B0BRBZRTM2/\"></core-commerce></p> \n<p>\n <core-commerce id=\"affb9482d05c466385eb81b42f862de2\" data-type=\"product-list\" data-original-url=\"https://www.amazon.com/Garmin-Wireless-Connectivity-Measure-Muscle/dp/B08JQPRNVX\"></core-commerce></p> \n<p>\n <core-commerce id=\"7bed6c983d074ffdbc46ebe488671713\" data-type=\"product-list\" data-original-url=\"https://www.amazon.com/WITHINGS-Body-Comp-Bluetooth-Compatible/dp/B0C34ZWCXH/\"></core-commerce></p> \n<h2 id=\"jump-link-what-to-look-for-in-a-smart-scale\">What to look for in a smart scale</h2> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-weight\">Weight</h3> \n<p>A scale that measures weight is probably the top requirement, right? Whether you&#39;re after a basic weight scale or a full-featured body fat scale, bear in mind, with all these measurements, the readings won’t be as accurate as a calibrated clinical scale. It’s better to focus on the overall trend, up or down over time, rather than a single measurement in isolation. Scales offering high-precision measurements can help, especially if you’re looking at the data to inform a specific health or fitness goal.</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-connectivity\">Connectivity</h3> \n<p>Before you buy your scale, work out how you’re planning on weighing yourself and when, as it is an issue. Some lower-end smart bathroom scales connect via Bluetooth and have no internal storage, so if you don’t have your phone to hand, it won’t record your weight. If your scale has Wi-Fi, then your scale can post the data to a server, letting you access them from any compatible device. Also, you should be mindful that some smart scales aren’t built with security in mind, so there’s a small risk to your privacy should your scale be compromised.</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-bone-density\">Bone density</h3> \n<p>The stronger your bones are, the less risk you have of breaks and osteoporosis — common concerns as you get older. Clinical bone density tests use low-power x-rays and some scales can offer you an at-home approximation. These bone mass tests pass a small electrical current through your feet, measuring the resistance as it completes its journey. The resistance offered by bones, fat and muscle are all different, letting your scale identify the difference. A body composition monitor often includes this feature, too, providing a detailed breakdown of bone density, fat and muscle mass.</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-body-fat-percentage-and-muscle-mass\">Body fat percentage and muscle mass</h3> \n<p>Fat and muscle are necessary parts of our makeup, but too much of either can be problematic. Much like bone density, a body composition measurement feature can monitor your body fat and muscle mass percentages using Bioelectrical Impedance Analysis (BIA). This measurement tests how well your body resists an electrical signal passing through your body. (It’s a rough rule of thumb you should have a 30/70 percent split between fat and muscle, but please consult a medical professional for figures specific to your own body and medical needs.) For those with specific athletic goals, smart scales offer an athlete mode to better tailor readings for accuracy. If body fat monitoring is a priority, look for a model marketed as a body fat scale.</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-bmi\">BMI</h3> \n<p>A lot of scales offer a BMI calculation, and it’s easy to do since you just plot height and weight on a set graph line. Body Mass Index is, however, a problematic measurement that its critics say is both <a data-i13n=\"cpos:8;pos:1\" href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2930234/\">overly simplistic</a> and often <a data-i13n=\"cpos:9;pos:1\" href=\"https://www.pennmedicine.org/news/news-releases/2013/august/obesitymortality-paradox-demon\">greatly misleading</a>. Unfortunately, it’s also one of the most common clinical body metrics and medical professionals will use it to make judgements about your care.</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-pulse-wave-velocity\">Pulse Wave Velocity</h3> \n<p>French health-tech company Withings has offered Pulse Wave Velocity (PWV) on its flagship scale for some time, although regulatory concerns meant it was withdrawn for a period. It’s a measurement of arterial stiffness, which acts as a marker both of cardiovascular risk and other health conditions. For those looking for an even deeper understanding of their health, some scales now offer a body scan, which provides more advanced metrics such as segmental body composition and vascular health insights.</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-wearables-and-integration\">Wearables and integration</h3> \n<p>Pairing your smart scale with wearables like <a data-i13n=\"cpos:10;pos:1\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/wearables/best-fitness-trackers-133053484.html\">fitness trackers</a> or <a data-i13n=\"cpos:11;pos:1\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/best-smartwatches-153013118.html\">smartwatches</a> can further enhance your health-tracking ecosystem. Many smart scales sync directly with platforms like Fitbit or Apple Health, making it easier to track trends and analyze your data in one place.</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-display\">Display</h3> \n<p>Less a specification and more a note: Smart bathroom scales have displays ranging from pre-printed LCDs or digital dot matrix layouts through to color display screens. On the high end, your scale display can show you trending charts for your weight and other vital statistics, and can even tell you the day’s weather. If you are short-sighted, and plan on weighing yourself first thing in the morning, before you’ve found your glasses or contacts, opt for a big, clear, high-contrast display.</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-app-and-subscriptions\">App and subscriptions</h3> \n<p>You’ll spend most of your time looking at your health data through its companion scales app, and it’s vital you get a good one. This includes a clear, clean layout with powerful tools to visualize your progress and analyze your data to look for places you can improve. Given that you often don’t need to buy anything before trying the app, it’s worth testing one or two to see if you vibe with it. It’s also important you check app compatibility before making your purchase. Some health apps will only work with iOS or Android — not both. Apple Watch connectivity can also be a bonus for tracking workouts and health metrics seamlessly. Several companies also offer premium subscriptions, unlocking other features – including insights and coaching – to go along with your hardware.</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-data-portability\">Data portability</h3> \n<p>Using the same scale or app platform for years at a time means you’ll build up a massive trove of personal data. And it is (or should be), your right to take that data to another provider if you choose to move platforms in the future. Data portability is, however, a minefield, with different platforms offering wildly different options, making it easy (or hard) to go elsewhere.</p> \n<p>All of the devices in this round-up will allow you to export your data to a .CSV file, which you can then do with as you wish. Importing this information is trickier, with Withings and Garmin allowing it, and Omron, Xiaomi, Eufy and Fitbit not making it that easy. (Apps that engage with Apple Health, meanwhile, can output all of your health data in a .XML file.)</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-power\">Power</h3> \n<p>It’s not a huge issue but one worth bearing in mind that each scale will either run disposable batteries (most commonly 4xAAA) or with its own, built-in battery pack. Either choice adds an environmental and financial cost to your scale’s life — either with regular purchases of fresh cells or the potential for the whole unit to become waste when the battery pack fails.</p> \n<h2 id=\"jump-link-how-we-tested-and-which-smart-scales-we-tested\">How we tested and which smart scales we tested</h2> \n<p>For this guide, I tested six scales from major manufacturers:</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-mi-xiaomi-body-composition-scale-2\">Mi (Xiaomi) Body Composition Scale 2</h3> \n<p>Our cheapest model, Xiaomi / Mi’s Body Composition Scale 2 is as bare-bones as you can get, and it shows. It often takes a long while to lock on to get your body weight, and when it does you’ll have to delve into the Zepp Life-branded scales app in order to look at your extra data. But you can’t fault it for the basics, offering limited (but accurate) weight measurements and body composition for less than the price of a McDonald’s for four.</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-fitbit-aira-air\"><a data-i13n=\"elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:;cpos:12;pos:1\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;itemId=amazon_B07VV6GKDS&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=b2af2a56-de99-4a43-8bd9-d5e576825e83&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;linkText=Fitbit+Aira+Air&amp;custData=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&amp;signature=AQAAAdDj-ypNk63duXjFYMZLF1GZcRdUXDvoLBQxEMFoUkT_&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FFitbit-FB203BK-Bluetooth-Digital-Weight%2Fdp%2FB07VV6GKDS\" class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" data-original-link=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9GaXRiaXQtRkIyMDNCSy1CbHVldG9vdGgtRGlnaXRhbC1XZWlnaHQvZHAvQjA3VlY2R0tEUz90YWc9Z2RndDBjLXAtby1jci0yMCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiYjJhZjJhNTYtZGU5OS00YTQzLThiZDktZDVlNTc2ODI1ZTgzIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAdedVAmboPWBTWdpUHTI7X3sMt__hDB1_bW8Ef-Yq4yH&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FFitbit-FB203BK-Bluetooth-Digital-Weight%2Fdp%2FB07VV6GKDS\">Fitbit Aira Air</a></h3> \n<p>Fitbit, now part of Google, is the household name for fitness trackers and smartwatches in the US, right? If not, then it must be at least halfway synonymous with it. The Aria Air is the company’s stripped-to-the-bare bones scale, offering your weight and a few other health metrics, but you can trust that Fitbit got the basics right. Not to mention that most of the reason for buying a Fitbit product is to leverage its fitness app anyway.</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-anker-eufy-smart-scale-p2-pro\"><a data-i13n=\"elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:;cpos:13;pos:1\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;itemId=amazon_B09NHR4NX7&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=b2af2a56-de99-4a43-8bd9-d5e576825e83&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;linkText=Anker+Eufy+Smart+Scale+P2+Pro&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5hbWF6b24uY29tL2V1ZnktQmF0aHJvb20tQmx1ZXRvb3RoLU1lYXN1cmVtZW50cy1JbmNsdWRpbmcvZHAvQjA5TkhSNE5YNy8_dGFnPWdkZ3QwYy0yMCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiYjJhZjJhNTYtZGU5OS00YTQzLThiZDktZDVlNTc2ODI1ZTgzIiwib3JpZ2luYWxVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5hbWF6b24uY29tL2V1ZnktQmF0aHJvb20tQmx1ZXRvb3RoLU1lYXN1cmVtZW50cy1JbmNsdWRpbmcvZHAvQjA5TkhSNE5YNy8iLCJkeW5hbWljQ2VudHJhbFRyYWNraW5nSWQiOnRydWUsInNpdGVJZCI6InVzLWVuZ2FkZ2V0IiwicGFnZUlkIjoiMXAtYXV0b2xpbmsiLCJmZWF0dXJlSWQiOiJ0ZXh0LWxpbmsifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAYVgINAbRwRm3giJnZ1bBorlgvMu7GYl3c23mPKttCkx&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Feufy-Bathroom-Bluetooth-Measurements-Including%2Fdp%2FB09NHR4NX7%2F\" class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" data-original-link=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9ldWZ5LUJhdGhyb29tLUJsdWV0b290aC1NZWFzdXJlbWVudHMtSW5jbHVkaW5nL2RwL0IwOU5IUjROWDcvP3RhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLWNyLTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJiMmFmMmE1Ni1kZTk5LTRhNDMtOGJkOS1kNWU1NzY4MjVlODMifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAQkVA5ofcfXgBHkGUcOOXsKMlPTtBM0pu-dOKiWpfQM9&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Feufy-Bathroom-Bluetooth-Measurements-Including%2Fdp%2FB09NHR4NX7%2F\">Anker Eufy Smart Scale P2 Pro</a></h3> \n<p>Eufy’s Smart Scale P2 Pro has plenty of things to commend it – the price, the overall look and feel (it’s a snazzy piece of kit) and what it offers. It offers a whole host of in-depth functionality, including Body Fat, Muscle Mass, Water Weight, Body Fat Mass and Bone Mass measurements, as well as calculating things like your Heart Rate and Basal Metabolic Rate (the amount of calories you need to eat a day to not change weight at all) all from inside its app. In fact, buried beneath the friendly graphic, the scale offers a big pile of stats and data that should, I think, give you more than a little coaching on how to improve your overall health.</p> \n<p>It’s worth noting that Anker – Eufy’s parent company – was identified as having misled users, and the media, about the security of its products a few years back. Its Eufy-branded security cameras, which the company says does not broadcast video outside of your local network, was found to be allowing third parties to access streams online. Consequently, while we have praised the Eufy Smart Scale for its own features, we cannot recommend it without a big caveat.</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-omron-bcm-500-body-composition-and-scale-with-bluetooth\"><a data-i13n=\"elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:;cpos:14;pos:1\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;itemId=amazon_B07WHMBH8K&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=b2af2a56-de99-4a43-8bd9-d5e576825e83&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;linkText=Omron+BCM-500+Body+Composition+and+Scale+with+Bluetooth&amp;custData=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&amp;signature=AQAAAWE-PF1FIn0SfsfHN5zib4pWHzpKvbnqRagnX09i-stV&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FOmron-Composition-Monitor-Bluetooth-Connectivity%2Fdp%2FB07WHMBH8K\" class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" data-original-link=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9PbXJvbi1Db21wb3NpdGlvbi1Nb25pdG9yLUJsdWV0b290aC1Db25uZWN0aXZpdHkvZHAvQjA3V0hNQkg4Sz90YWc9Z2RndDBjLXAtby1jci0yMCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiYjJhZjJhNTYtZGU5OS00YTQzLThiZDktZDVlNTc2ODI1ZTgzIn0&amp;signature=AQAAASi75Tjd0SgYfb-B9rkmhg6WTzW1HyxGlJthfPDFT3f3&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FOmron-Composition-Monitor-Bluetooth-Connectivity%2Fdp%2FB07WHMBH8K\">Omron BCM-500 Body Composition and Scale with Bluetooth</a></h3> \n<p>Given its role in making actual medical devices, you know what you’re getting with an Omron product.

I’m also a big fan of the wealth of data and different metrics the scale throws at you – you can see a full color graph charting your weight measurements and goal progress, and the various metrics it tracks in good detail.

A smart scale, on the other hand, does much more. Not only does it give you your weight measurements, but it can also track things like your body fat percentage, muscle mass, and even your BMI. Some smart scales even monitor more advanced metrics like bone density, depending on the model.</p> \n<p>What’s even better is that smart scales sync with scales apps on your phone using Wi-Fi or Bluetooth, so you can see all your health data in one place. This lets you monitor trends over time, like if your muscle mass is increasing or your body fat percentage decreasing.</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-how-do-smart-scales-work-with-more-than-one-person-using-it\">How do smart scales work with more than one person using it?</h3> \n<p>When more than one person in a household uses the smart scale, it usually recognizes each person by their weight range and other body measurements (like body fat percentage). Most smart scales allow you to set up individual profiles in the companion app, and once your profile is linked, the scale can automatically figure out who’s standing on it.</p> \n<p>Let’s say you and a family member have fairly different weights — the scale will easily know who’s who based on that. But if you and someone else have similar weights, it might ask you to confirm the profile on your phone after the weigh-in. Some scales even let you assign a profile manually in the scales app if it’s not sure.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/home/smart-home/best-smart-scale-160033523.html?src=rss",

    "title": "Instagram chief: AI is so ubiquitous 'it will be more practical to fingerprint real media than fake media'",
    "body": "<p>It&#39;s no secret that AI-generated content <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/techs-biggest-winners-of-2025-180000177.html\" data-i13n=\"cpos:1;pos:1\">took over</a> our social media feeds in 2025. Now, Instagram&#39;s top exec Adam Mosseri has made it clear that he expects AI content to overtake non-AI imagery and the significant implications that shift has for its creators and photographers.</p><p>Mosseri shared the thoughts in <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.threads.com/@mosseri/post/DS76UiklIDf/media\" data-i13n=\"cpos:2;pos:1\">a lengthy post</a> about the broader trends he expects to shape Instagram in 2026. And he offered a notably candid assessment on how AI is upending the platform. &quot;Everything that made creators matter—the ability to be real, to connect, to have a voice that couldn’t be faked—is now suddenly accessible to anyone with the right tools,&quot; he wrote. &quot;The feeds are starting to fill up with synthetic everything.&quot;</p><p>But Mosseri doesn&#39;t seem particularly concerned by this shift. He says that there is &quot;a lot of amazing AI content&quot; and that the platform may need to rethink its approach to labeling such imagery by &quot;fingerprinting real media, not just chasing fake.&quot;</p><p>From Mosseri (emphasis his):</p><blockquote><p>Social media platforms are going to come under increasing pressure to identify and label AI-generated content as such. All the major platforms will do good work identifying AI content, but they will get worse at it over time as AI gets better at imitating reality. There is already a growing number of people who believe, as I do, that<strong> it will be more practical to fingerprint real media than fake media</strong>. Camera manufacturers could cryptographically sign images at capture, creating a chain of custody.</p></blockquote><p>On some level, it&#39;s easy to understand how this seems like a more practical approach for Meta. As we&#39;ve previously reported, technologies that are meant to identify AI content, like watermarks, have proved unreliable at best. They are <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/researchers-say-current-ai-watermarks-are-trivial-to-remove-204414059.html\" data-i13n=\"cpos:3;pos:1\">easy to remove</a> and even easier to ignore altogether. Meta&#39;s own labels are <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/social-media/meta-hides-warning-labels-for-ai-edited-images-143004313.html\" data-i13n=\"cpos:4;pos:1\">far from clear</a> and the company, which has spent tens of billions of dollars on AI this year alone, has admitted it <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/social-media/the-oversight-board-calls-metas-uneven-ai-moderation-incoherent-and-unjustifiable-100056893.html\" data-i13n=\"cpos:5;pos:1\">can&#39;t reliably detect</a> AI-generated or manipulated content on its platform.</p><p>That Mosseri is so readily admitting defeat on this issue, though, is telling. AI slop has won. And when it comes to helping Instagram&#39;s 3 billion users understand what <em>is</em> real, that should largely be someone else&#39;s problem, not Meta&#39;s. Camera makers — presumably phone makers and actual camera manufacturers — should come up with their own system that sure sounds a lot like watermarking to &quot;to verify authenticity at capture.&quot; Mosseri offers few details about how this would work or be implemented at the scale required to make it feasible.</p><p>Mosseri also doesn&#39;t really address the fact that this is likely to alienate the many photographers and other Instagram creators who have already grown frustrated with the app. The exec regularly fields complaints from the group who want to know why Instagram&#39;s algorithm doesn&#39;t consistently surface their posts to their on followers.</p><p>But Mosseri suggests those complaints stem from an outdated vision of what Instagram even is. The feed of &quot;polished&quot; square images, he says, &quot;is dead.&quot; Camera companies, in his estimation, are &quot;are betting on the wrong aesthetic&quot; by trying to &quot;make everyone look like a professional photographer from the past.&quot; Instead, he says that more &quot;raw&quot; and &quot;unflattering&quot; images will be how creators can prove they are real, and not AI. In a world where Instagram has more AI content than not, creators should prioritize images and videos that intentionally make them look bad.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/social-media/instagram-chief-ai-is-so-ubiquitous-it-will-be-more-practical-to-fingerprint-real-media-than-fake-media-202620080.html?src=rss",

That&#39;s because the traditional end-of-press-day slot isn&#39;t just Sony, but rather Sony Honda Mobility — the joint venture responsible for the Afeela 1 electric car that has been showcased at CES for the better part of a decade. This year, however, we&#39;ll also apparently get to see a an all-new concept model at the event, too.&nbsp;</p>\n<h2 id=\"jump-link-how-to-watch-the-sony-afeela-ces-2026-press-conference\">How to watch the Sony Afeela CES 2026 press conference</h2>\n<p>The event will be streamed live from Las Vegas on Monday, January 5 at 8PM ET via the <a data-i13n=\"cpos:1;pos:1\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/@shmafeela\">Afeela official YouTube channel</a>.

But so many more important details were confirmed in the past couple of years, including the price, which starts at a staggering $89,900. However, the earlier impressions were less than impressive, and as of CES 2025, that thought remains the same. Engadget&#39;s automotive expert Tim Stevens said earlier this year that the EV &quot;<a data-i13n=\"cpos:3;pos:1\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/transportation/evs/sonys-afeela-1-feels-like-a-playstation-4-in-the-ps5-era-184620132.html\">feels like a PlayStation 4 in the PS5 era</a>,&quot; and that &quot;the car lost what little interesting styling it had while sticking true to some specifications that sounded good five years ago.&quot; Ouch.</p>\n<p>But the Afeela 1 won&#39;t be the only vehicle on display. Its CES booth will showcase &quot;several Afeela 1 pre-production vehicles in multiple color variations, alongside a new Afeela concept model,&quot; Sony Honda Mobility <a data-i13n=\"cpos:4;pos:1\" href=\"https://www.shm-afeela.com/en/news/2025-11-20/\">said in a press release</a>.</p>\n<p>We&#39;re hoping to hear about what&#39;s new and improved at CES 2026, and we&#39;re also excited to see its newest concept model. And between booth displays and press releases, we&#39;re hoping we&#39;ll get to see at least a few new Sony Electronics products on the docket for 2026, too.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/transportation/evs/how-to-watch-the-sony-honda-afeela-ces-2026-press-conference-130048622.html?src=rss",

LG, for example, has said it will <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/home/home-theater/lg-will-debut-its-first-micro-rgb-television-at-ces-010037923.html\" data-i13n=\"cpos:14;pos:1\">debut its first Micro RGB television at CES</a>.

Next year, Samsung is expanding the range with 55-, 65-, 75-, 85-, 100- and 115-inch models that use the next evolution of the company’s Micro RGB technology. </p><p>Samsung is also countering LG’s 5K monitors with a <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/computing/accessories/samsungs-latest-odyssey-gaming-monitor-has-a-32-inch-6k-screen-with-glasses-free-3d-130051748.html\" data-i13n=\"cpos:22;pos:1\">6K model</a> that aims to deliver glasses-free 3D (another long-time CES staple).

    "body": "<p>Chances are that if a VPN is marketed to everyday users, it more or less runs itself. As long as you go with one of the <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/best-vpn-130004396.html\" data-i13n=\"cpos:1;pos:1\">best VPNs</a> instead of setting up your own manual connection, the interface is likely built so you have to engage with it as little as possible. Generally, if you find yourself constantly thinking about your VPN while using it — as happened to me with <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/norton-vpn-review-a-vpn-that-fails-to-meet-nortons-standards-170037086.html\" data-i13n=\"cpos:2;pos:1\">Norton VPN</a> — that&#39;s a bad thing and you should change providers.</p><p>That said, it&#39;s still useful to get a high-level view of how to use a VPN, especially if you&#39;ve never used one before. In this article, I&#39;ll walk you through how to download, install and configure a VPN on any platform and how to choose servers for specific situations. I&#39;ll also discuss specific steps for desktop and laptop computers, phones, tablets, smart TVs, game consoles and routers.</p><h2 id=\"e5ae9320-9e97-41d7-9412-e57ddfe9f8d5\">How to download and install a VPN</h2><p>There are over 100 VPNs available on the internet and the two big mobile app stores, but most of them follow a similar approach to download and installation. Except for certain <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/best-free-vpn-120032818.html\" data-i13n=\"cpos:3;pos:1\">free VPNs</a>, you&#39;ll need to create an account on the VPN provider&#39;s website, install the VPN client, then use your account to log in. Here are the steps.</p><ol><li><p>In a web browser, navigate to a VPN provider&#39;s website. For suggestions on where to start, check out our list of the <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/deals/the-best-vpn-deals-up-to-88-percent-off-protonvpn-surfshark-expressvpn-nordvpn-and-more-120056445.html\" data-i13n=\"cpos:4;pos:1\">best VPN deals</a>. Click any link that mentions getting the VPN or claiming the deal — as a rule, they aren&#39;t hard to find.</p></li><li><p>Select a plan based on the length of time you need the VPN for, the features you want and the number of devices you&#39;d like to use the VPN on simultaneously. Add a payment method. You&#39;ll be prompted to create the username and password for a new account.</p></li><li><p><strong>On desktop</strong>, you can start with the Mac or Windows app store, though some VPNs require a download directly from their respective website. That’s generally the way to get the most feature-rich version of the VPN, but just make sure you’re downloading from the provider’s website to ensure you don’t get a malicious copycat. <strong>On mobile</strong>, the app store is your only choice, but don&#39;t forget to check the reviews and make sure you&#39;re getting the service you paid for — unfortunately, rival (and sometimes less scrupulous) VPN brands can use paid placements to appear higher on search results, even for a rival product. </p></li><li><p>Follow the pre-programmed installation flow. Again, don&#39;t let a VPN make any changes to your system if you haven&#39;t thoroughly vetted the provider (or gone with one of our recommendations). If it&#39;s safe, allow the VPN all the setup permissions it needs.</p></li><li><p>Finally, open the VPN client and sign in with the credentials you created in step two. You&#39;re now ready to start using your new VPN.</p></li></ol><figure><img src=\"https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/Downloading_Surfshark_on_Mac.png\" data-crop-orig-src=\"https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/Downloading_Surfshark_on_Mac.png\" style=\"height:869px;width:1829px;\" alt=\"Surfshark in Mac downloads folder\" data-uuid=\"56f3ed7f-7483-4fc3-aed9-c2e389da2de0\"><figcaption>Surfshark in Mac downloads folder</figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Sam Chapman for Engadget</div></figure><p>With so many VPNs on the market, this process won&#39;t always be the same. Sometimes you&#39;ll have to make the account before paying, and some mobile VPNs let you handle the whole process in-app. What&#39;s always true, though, is that a good VPN will make the signup flow as easy as possible. If you have trouble before you even log in, that&#39;s a red flag.</p><h3 id=\"eab57cd3-f062-45cc-b880-91db0fe05fa4\">How to configure a VPN app</h3><p>Most VPNs are ready to go out of the box. However, even if you don&#39;t think you&#39;re a power user, it&#39;s a good idea to go through the settings and make sure they match what you need. Here are a few steps I recommend taking.</p><ol><li><p>Activate the kill switch. This feature monitors your connection to the VPN server. If it ever drops — either from problems in the server, your client or somewhere in between — the kill switch instantly cuts off your internet until your VPN connection is restored. This saves you from accidentally broadcasting anything sensitive while also ensuring you only connect to legitimate VPN servers (avoiding the <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.tunnelvisionbug.com/\" data-i13n=\"cpos:5;pos:1\">Tunnelvision bug</a>).</p></li><li><p>Set up favorites and profiles. VPNs usually let you select servers you&#39;ll use regularly, websites you&#39;ll often connect to through the VPN and other preferences that will appear immediately when you open the app. Some go further, like <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/proton-vpn-review-2025-a-nonprofit-service-with-premium-performance-153046073.html\" data-i13n=\"cpos:6;pos:1\">Proton VPN</a>, which lets you create user profiles that bundle several preferences together.</p></li><li><p>Decide if you want the VPN to automatically launch and connect when you start up your computer.</p></li><li><p>Check on split tunneling. There may be cases where you want a certain app or site to work outside the VPN, or where you want everything to go unencrypted except one site or app. You can set up a split tunnel when you need it, but if there&#39;s one you know you&#39;ll use regularly, it helps to build it early.</p></li><li><p>Activate or deactivate any content blockers the VPN comes with, including ad blockers, malware detectors and parental controls, as you see fit.</p></li><li><p>Decide whether you want the VPN to send you notifications, and how.</p></li><li><p>Select a VPN protocol. It&#39;s almost always best to let the VPN choose for itself, but it&#39;s helpful to at least know where the protocol-switching option is. Occasionally, if one protocol isn&#39;t working, you can troubleshoot by selecting another.</p></li></ol><p>You can do all this by digging into your VPN&#39;s preferences control panel. A gear seems to be the universal icon for that, but Mac users may also find it by picking &quot;preferences&quot; or &quot;settings&quot; from the menu bar. When you find the preferences menu, go through each tab in turn and make sure everything is the way you like it.</p><h3 id=\"511e0968-4f3a-4690-aad7-bfb431046f9b\">How to choose a VPN server</h3><p>Picking a server location is the final box to check before connecting. You nearly always have the option of letting the VPN pick the best server. Most apps tend to determine the best server with a latency test, so it will almost always be a node very close to your physical location.</p><p>If you just want anonymity online, that&#39;s fine — it doesn&#39;t matter which IP address you use as long as it&#39;s not your real one. But several VPN use cases do require a specific server location. For those, follow one simple rule: Pick a server in the place you want your signal to come from.</p><figure><img src=\"https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/Surfshark_for_How_to_Use.png\" data-crop-orig-src=\"https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/Surfshark_for_How_to_Use.png\" style=\"height:1188px;width:1588px;\" alt=\"Choosing locations on Surfshark\" data-uuid=\"ad20ffff-2e09-42e7-93d3-bcae41563393\"><figcaption>Choosing locations on Surfshark</figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Sam Chapman for Engadget</div></figure><p>For example, let&#39;s say you want to watch <em>The Office, </em>but you&#39;re only subscribed to Netflix and not Peacock. Luckily, Netflix is licensed to show <em>The Office </em>in the U.K. If you connect to a British server location before opening Netflix, you&#39;ll be able to access the show without paying for an extra subscription. (Of course, make sure VPNs aren’t expressly banned by the streaming service’s terms of service before accessing it while using one.)</p><p>Other than streaming, the most common reason you&#39;ll need a specific VPN server is to get around firewalls that block websites. Whether it&#39;s your school doing the censorship, your workplace or your entire state, the solution is the same: Pick a VPN server outside the restricted region. Censorship systems filter by location — they can&#39;t block where they don&#39;t have jurisdiction. Get a new virtual location and you should be free and clear. (Always be cognizant of the laws on VPN usage in your location before activating them.)</p><h3 id=\"5ea22123-706d-4712-80ee-c4c41d00eaa2\">When to use a VPN (and when not to)</h3><p>It&#39;s good to get into the habit of connecting to your VPN whenever you get online. You can never be sure what information your ISP is gathering on you. If you&#39;re using unprotected Wi-Fi, or a public network with a clearly visible password, anybody might be listening in. Even if you don&#39;t need a particular location, always be using your VPN.</p><p>The only reason you might want to be online without a VPN is that certain websites, especially online banks, get suspicious if they note repeated logins to the same account from too many different IP addresses. For those cases, you can either set up a split tunnel to exclude the website from encryption, or temporarily turn your VPN off altogether.</p><h2 id=\"1254cc3e-6927-44fa-9785-06bcc25cbd13\">Instructions for specific devices</h2><p>Although most VPNs try to keep their apps similar on every platform, the strictures of differing hardware and software lead them to install and operate differently. In case you still have questions after reading the general guide above, this section goes into detail on every platform where you might use a VPN.</p><h3 id=\"69d7feab-ae9f-4c04-b668-4b23ed247ede\">How to use a VPN on desktop</h3><p>After subscribing to a VPN on <strong>Windows</strong>, you should be directed to download an EXE file — if this doesn&#39;t happen, log into your account on the website and find the downloads center. Find the folder where the EXE is saved, double-click it and follow the onscreen instructions.</p><p>On <strong>Mac</strong>, the process is more or less the same, except you&#39;ll usually get a PKG file instead of an EXE. Go to your downloads folder (either in Finder or through your web browser) and double-click the PKG file. Grant the VPN whatever permissions it needs. (Again, this is why it’s important to only use a legitimate vendor, such as the ones we recommend.)</p><p>Once installed, you can open the VPN client at any time by double-clicking the icon again. Some VPNs open as separate windows, while others will add icons to your toolbar. This often varies by platform; if you&#39;re concerned that your VPN doesn&#39;t look like a screenshot you&#39;ve seen, check which operating system the image comes from.</p><h3 id=\"6a9b37a7-441d-49e7-994c-5701c621aa09\">How to use a VPN on mobile</h3><p>On <strong>Android </strong>and <strong>iOS</strong>, you&#39;ll download your VPN app through the Google Play Store or Apple App Store, respectively. Even if you get started through a mobile browser, it will probably redirect you to the app store for the actual download and installation.</p><p>Follow the usual step for downloading an app: search for its name in the app store, click &quot;Get&quot; or &quot;Install,&quot; then let your phone cook. As always, so long as it&#39;s a vetted VPN, grant it the permissions it needs. You may be able to download and install the VPN first, then create your account and submit payment through the app afterward.</p><p>One final note: several leading VPNs offer free trials for mobile users. If you see a button that says something like &quot;get free trial,&quot; you may be able to use the VPN for several days without paying. Just be warned that if the trial lapses, you might get automatically signed up for a plan that&#39;s longer than you&#39;d like.</p><h3 id=\"ba5edfbb-5471-45fc-9fc0-70bc182b1fad\">How to use a VPN browser extension</h3><p>VPNs offer browser extensions as lightweight versions of their main clients. While a desktop or mobile VPN reroutes everything that device sends to the internet, a browser extension only protects traffic through your web browser. You can use one as a primitive form of split tunneling, but they&#39;re mainly for basic convenience — most of what you do online goes through a browser, so it&#39;s nice to be able to protect your connection without opening a separate app.</p><figure><img src=\"https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/NordVPN_browser_extension.png\" data-crop-orig-src=\"https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/NordVPN_browser_extension.png\" style=\"height:1352px;width:2673px;\" alt=\"NordVPN browser extension on Chrome\" data-uuid=\"a448ba0a-eb2d-4c2f-8d5a-75d05e9b58ad\"><figcaption>NordVPN browser extension on Chrome</figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Sam Chapman for Engadget</div></figure><p>To use a VPN browser extension, just create your account as normal, then download the extension from your VPN&#39;s website. You can manage it from your browser&#39;s extensions center. That&#39;s a jigsaw piece at the top-right corner on most browsers, including Chrome, Edge and Firefox.</p><h3 id=\"281a98b7-ad86-42d8-960c-427b3d41fb36\">How to use a VPN on a smart TV</h3><p>You can use a VPN to change your location and stream international content directly to a smart TV. The catch is that not all smart TV brands support VPN apps. For those that don&#39;t, <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/how-to-add-vpn-to-your-tv-143736648.html\" data-i13n=\"cpos:7;pos:1\">you&#39;ll have to find a workaround</a>.</p><p>The good news is that a ton of the best smart TVs can natively host VPNs, including <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/how-to-use-a-vpn-on-chromecast-or-google-tv-140619467.html\" data-i13n=\"cpos:8;pos:1\">Google TV</a>, Android TV, <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/how-to-add-a-vpn-on-fire-tv-101822833.html\" data-i13n=\"cpos:9;pos:1\">Amazon Fire TV</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/how-to-use-a-vpn-on-apple-tv-113345245.html\" data-i13n=\"cpos:10;pos:1\">Apple TV</a> (though only tvOS 17 and above).

You can also install a VPN on your router (see below) so your smart TV automatically uses the router&#39;s location.</p><p>Finally, you can get a temporary fix by using your computer as a Wi-Fi hotspot while it has a VPN active. Follow the steps for your operating system.</p><p>On Windows:</p><ol><li><p>In your system settings, go to &quot;Network &amp; Internet&quot; and turn on the mobile hotspot.</p></li><li><p>Go to &quot;Network &amp; Sharing Center&quot; and click &quot;Change adapter settings.&quot;</p></li><li><p>Right-click the name of your VPN provider and go to &quot;Properties,&quot; then &quot;Sharing.&quot;</p></li><li><p>Check the boxes next to &quot;Allow other network users to connect through this computer&#39;s internet connection&quot; and &quot;Allow other network users to control or disable the shared internet connection.&quot;</p></li><li><p>Click the &quot;Home networking connection&quot; dropdown and select &quot;Microsoft Wi-Fi Direct Virtual Adapter.&quot;</p></li><li><p>Open your VPN client and connect to a server in your desired location.</p></li><li><p>On your smart TV, open the internet connections menu and select the name of your PC.

A &quot;configuration&quot; is a complete set of the information needed to access a certain VPN server through a certain protocol — say, a Proton VPN server in Arizona through OpenVPN. Download a configuration file for the protocol and location you want all your home devices to connect through.</p><p>Finally, open your router control panel by entering your router&#39;s IP address into a web browser address bar, then log in with your router credentials (these should be marked on the router itself unless you&#39;ve changed them). Go to the VPN tab — which should be there if it&#39;s a router with VPN firmware — and upload the profile you downloaded from the VPN website. Use the same router control panel to activate and deactivate the router VPN connection.</p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/how-to-use-a-vpn-140000564.html?src=rss",

However, I’m still a big believer in compact cameras. They’re a noticeable step up from smartphones quality-wise, and a lot of people will take a compact traveling or to events when they’d never bother with the hassle of a DSLR or mirrorless camera.</p> \n<p>Compacts largely have type 1-inch sensors, but a few offer larger options, particularly Fujifilm’s XF-100V. Another popular model, Sony’s XV-1, is primarily aimed at content creators looking to step up. In any case, desirable qualities include image quality, a fast lens, relatively long zoom, flip-out display, good battery life, a high quality EVF, decent video and good pocketability.</p> \n<p>\n <core-commerce id=\"cd03eff4cbdc4130bf293bf0147c94d1\" data-type=\"product-list\" data-original-url=\"https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1811352-REG/fujifilm_16821822_x100vi_digital_camera_silver.html\"></core-commerce></p> \n<p>\n <core-commerce id=\"1e50f52ddf4d41d6aee53f485e29a24c\" data-type=\"product-list\" data-original-url=\"https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Camera-Content-Creators-Vloggers/dp/B0C62F451G\"></core-commerce></p> \n<h2 id=\"jump-link-what-to-consider-before-choosing-a-camera\">What to consider before choosing a camera</h2> \n<p>Though smartphones get better for video and photos every year, full cameras still have an edge in many ways. The larger sensors in mirrorless cameras let more light in, and you have a wide choice of lenses with far superior optics. Dedicated cameras are also faster for shooting things like sports or wildlife, offer superior video for content creators and create more professional results.</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-sensor-size\">Sensor size</h3> \n<p>There are a few key things to consider to get the most out of a camera. The first is sensor size: in general, the larger the sensor, the better (and usually more expensive) the camera.</p> \n<p>Full frame is the largest sensor size for mainstream cameras, and it’s available on models like the new Panasonic S9, the Nikon Z III and Canon EOS R5 II. At a size equivalent to 35mm film (36 x 24mm), it offers the best performance in terms of image quality, low-light capability and depth of field. But it’s also very expensive and finicky. While bokeh looks incredible at an aperture of f/1.4, the depth of field is so razor thin that your subject&#39;s eyebrow might be in focus but not their eye. This can also make shooting video difficult.</p> \n<p>The next size category is APS-C (around 23.5 x 15.6mm for most models and 22.2 x 14.8mm for Canon), offered on Fujifilm&#39;s X Series lineup, the Canon R10, the Sony ZV-E10 II and the Nikon Z50. It&#39;s cheaper than full frame, both for the camera body and lenses, but still brings most of the advantages like decent bokeh, high ISOs for low-light shooting and relatively high resolution. With a sensor size the same as movie cameras, it&#39;s ideal for shooting video, and it’s easier to hold focus than with full-frame cameras.</p> \n<p>Micro Four Thirds (17.3 x 13mm), a format shared by Panasonic and Olympus, is the next step down in sensor size. It offers less bokeh and light-gathering capability than APS-C and full frame, but allows for smaller and lighter cameras and lenses. For video, you can still get reasonably tight depth of field with good prime lenses, but focus is easier to control.</p> \n<p>The other common sensor size is Type 1 (1 inch), which is actually smaller than one inch at 12.7 x 9.5mm. That&#39;s used mostly by compact models like Sony’s ZV-1 vlogging camera. Finally, action cameras like the GoPro Hero 11 and DJI’s Osmo 3 have even smaller sensors (1/1.9 and 1/1.7 inches, respectively).</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-autofocus\">Autofocus</h3> \n<p>For photographers, another key factor is autofocus (AF) speed and accuracy. Most modern mirrorless cameras have hybrid phase-detect AF systems that allow for rapid focus and fast burst speeds. The majority also offer AI features like eye-detect AF for people and animals, which locks in on the subject’s eyes, face or body to keep them in focus. However, some models are faster and more reactive than others.</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-displays\">Displays</h3> \n<p>The electronic viewfinder (EVF) and rear display are also crucial. The best models have the sharpest and brightest EVFs that help you judge a shot before taking it. For things like street photography, it’s best to have as bright and sharp a rear display as possible, so it’s easy to see your subject and check focus in all manner of lighting conditions. You may also want a screen that flips out rather than just tilting, too.</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-lenses\">Lenses</h3> \n<p>DSLRs and mirrorless cameras let you change lenses, but you&#39;re stuck with what&#39;s built into a compact camera. While that&#39;s great for portability, a single lens means you&#39;re going to sacrifice <em>something</em> along the way. The Fujifilm X100V, for instance, has a fast but fixed 35mm-equivalent f/2.0 lens and no zoom. The Sony RX100 V has a 24-70mm zoom, but it&#39;s slower at the telephoto end (f/2.8) and less sharp than a fixed focal (prime) lens.</p> \n<p>When choosing a lens for a mirrorless camera, you’ll need to consider the focal or zoom length, along with the minimum aperture. Smaller numbers like f/1.4 for a prime lens or f/2.8 for a zoom are best, as they let you work in darker environments and maximize background blur to isolate your subject. However, those lenses are more complex and thus more expensive.</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-video-recording\">Video recording</h3> \n<p>When it comes to video, there are other factors to consider. Some cameras combine or skip over pixels (line skipping or pixel binning) for video recording, which is not ideal because it can reduce sharpness. Better cameras tend to read out the entire sensor and then “downsample” to improve video sharpness (camera manufacturers don’t often say if video is pixel binned, but will say if it’s downsampled). Another important factor is sensor speed, as slower sensors tend to have more rolling shutter that can create a “jello” effect that skews video.</p> \n<p>In addition, how’s the battery life? How do you like the handling and feel? How long can you shoot before the camera heats up or stops? Does it support 10-bit HDR video? Is there a microphone and/or a headphone jack? (If you record a lot of interviews, it&#39;s preferable to have both.) How&#39;s the video autofocus? All of these things play a part in your decision.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/cameras/best-cameras-151524327.html?src=rss",

In its worst-case-scenario model, the IDC predicts PC shipments could shrink by up to 8.9 percent in 2026 because of the high cost of memory.</p><p>&quot;Instead of expanding conventional DRAM and NAND used in smartphones, PCs and other consumer electronics, major memory makers have shifted production toward memory used in AI data centers, such as high-bandwidth (HBM) and high-capacity DDR5,&quot; IDC writes. That&#39;s continued to drive up the price of the RAM that is available for PC makers, which has naturally led to them to raise the price of their own products to stay above water. For example, modular PC maker Framework has already <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"link\" href=\"https://frame.work/blog/in-stock-on-framework-desktop-and-updates-on-the-industry-wide-silicon-crunch\" data-i13n=\"cpos:4;pos:1\">had to raise prices</a> on some of its laptops and parts, and says &quot;further cost and price increases are highly likely over the next months.&quot; The IDC says prices could rise by 6 to 8 percent in 2026 if its most pessimistic scenario comes true.</p><p>The timing of this RAM crunch is particularly ironic because selling <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/computing/amd-explains-its-ai-pc-strategy-123004804.html\" data-i13n=\"cpos:5;pos:1\">&quot;AI PCs&quot;</a> — computers with neural processing units that can run AI models locally — were supposed to be one of the things pulling the PC industry out of its post-pandemic slump. Instead, those computers&#39; larger RAM needs leave them more vulnerable to the effects of the AI industry itself. Computers aren&#39;t the only electronics impacted, either. The IDC says the average selling price of a smartphone could grow by 6 to 8 percent in its most pessimistic scenario, and smartphone shipments could shrink by as much as 5.2 percent.&nbsp;</p><p>Companies like Apple and Samsung, with cash to spare and long-term supply agreements, could weather these higher RAM prices and keep things consistent for a year or two, according to the IDC. For everyone else, though, the near-term is looking much more expensive, and by necessity, much less adventurous.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/computing/idc-warns-of-major-pc-market-downturn-due-to-memory-crunch-214510197.html?src=rss",

The Galaxy A17 5G starts at $199 and will be available on January 7.

The photography setup is also unchanged from last year&#39;s model, with a 50MP main camera, 5MP ultrawide, 2MP macro and 13MP selfie lenses. The base model has 4GB of RAM and 128GB of storage, but can be upgraded with up to 2TB of additional storage via microSD. Its 5,000mAh battery also supports fast-charging, a feature we&#39;re <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/techs-biggest-winners-of-2025-180000177.html\" data-i13n=\"cpos:2;pos:1\">happy to see</a> becoming more of an industry standard this year.

Like with the Galaxy A17 5G, the tablet can also be juiced up with additional microSD storage. Performance-wise, you&#39;ll top out at 15 hours of video playback on the battery, but fast-charging is also supported here.

We also see Eleven climb back into the sensory-deprivation tank in the Upside Down, presumably to take the fight to the show’s big bad.</p>\n<p>The only continuous scene in the trailer shows most of the gang standing atop a radio tower as Vecna&#39;s world moves close enough to collide with the tower&#39;s tip.

Unlike the new Scribe, however, it doesn&#39;t use E Ink. The TCL Note A1 NXTPAPER is the company&#39;s latest device to use <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/tcl-nxtpaper-tablet-lcd-paper-color-video-price-specs-availability-tab-10s-5g-160025391.html\" data-i13n=\"cpos:2;pos:1\">NXTPAPER</a>, TCL&#39;s custom paper-like LCD screen, which offers some of the qualities of E Ink without the limitations.</p><p>TCL says the 11.5-inch color &quot;NXTPAPER Pure&quot; display on the Note A1 has a 2,200 x 1,440 resolution and a 120Hz refresh rate, which should mean it looks clearer and feels much smoother to interact with than the color E Ink screen used on something like the <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/mobile/tablets/remarkable-paper-pro-review-writing-in-color-is-nice-but-itll-cost-you-173024590.html\" data-i13n=\"cpos:3;pos:1\">reMarkable Paper Pro</a>. The tablet supports TCL&#39;s T-Pen Pro for taking notes and drawing on the screen, but also features eight built-in microphones for recording and transcribing audio. The Note A1 also has a 13-megapixel camera for scanning documents, an 8,000mAh battery and 256GB of storage, with the option to access cloud services like Google Drive or Microsoft OneDrive if you want it.&nbsp;</p><figure><img src=\"https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/TCL-Note-A1-NXTPAPER-bento.jpg\" data-crop-orig-src=\"https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/TCL-Note-A1-NXTPAPER-bento.jpg\" style=\"height:1440px;width:2560px;\" alt=\"A diagram of different Note A1 NXTPAPER features arranged in a grid.\" data-uuid=\"9bc06d6f-e801-4705-986e-42c1f2b210f2\"/><figcaption>A diagram of different Note A1 NXTPAPER features arranged in a grid.</figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">TCL</div></figure><p>Unlike TCL&#39;s past NXTPAPER tablets, the Note A1 doesn&#39;t prioritize media consumption — it&#39;s a productivity tool first and foremost. TCL says the device runs Android, but hasn&#39;t shared whether it&#39;ll have access to the Play Store. All the features the company has announced focus on taking notes and using AI to process and organize whatever you&#39;ve written down. The device will also support real-time translation and &quot;handwriting beautification,&quot; among a collection of other AI-powered features. </p><p>Engadget has reached out to TCL for more information on the Note A1 NXTPAPER&#39;s software. We&#39;ll update this article if we hear back.</p><p>There will likely never be one “Goldilocks” version of these note-taking devices, but the Note A1 NXTPAPER&#39;s combination of display and microphones does make it an intriguing, if limited, alternative to <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/mobile/tablets/booxs-new-go-7-e-ink-tablets-support-handwriting-with-a-46-stylus-182026839.html\" data-i13n=\"cpos:4;pos:1\">Boox&#39;s E Ink tablets</a>.

Most iPad covers are cases that surround the back of your tablet and have a flap that covers the screen, so it provides protection for the body as well as its display. Plenty of iPad cases also have screen covers, but you don’t have to get one with that feature. Instead, you could just get a case that hugs the back of the tablet and nothing else. Those accessories will be marginally thinner and lighter than their cover-toting counterparts, and give your iPad a more svelte profile.</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-how-often-should-i-charge-my-ipad\">How often should I charge my iPad?</h3> \n<p>How often you charge your iPad will depend on how often you use it. Most iPads will last at least a regular work day with frequent usage, which is one of the reasons why many have opted to use their iPads as laptop replacements. But with heavy usage, like constant video streaming or gaming, will come more rapid battery drain. A good rule of thumb is to charge your iPad when you go to sleep each night, that way you’ll have a topped-up device waiting for you in the morning.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/computing/accessories/best-ipad-cases-to-protect-your-tablet-130033533.html?src=rss",

On December 17, the Senate <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/science/space/jared-isaacman-is-nasas-new-leader-220833691.html\" data-i13n=\"cpos:2;pos:1\">confirmed billionaire Jared Isaacman</a> as the agency&#39;s new administrator. He now holds the power to rehabilitate a battered engine of scientific research, or steer it towards even more disruption.&nbsp;</p><p>Considering the caliber of President Trump&#39;s other appointees, Isaacman is probably the best candidate for the job. Outside of being a successful entrepreneur, he has flown fighter jets and been to space twice as part of the <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/spacex-inspiration4-mission-full-crew-143428383.html\" data-i13n=\"cpos:3;pos:1\">Inspiration4</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/science/space/polaris-dawn-is-finally-headed-to-space-for-its-groundbreaking-civilian-mission-093346616.html\" data-i13n=\"cpos:4;pos:1\">Polaris Dawn</a> private missions. One of those flights saw him <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/science/space/the-polaris-dawn-crew-is-back-on-earth-after-a-historic-mission-142028997.html\" data-i13n=\"cpos:5;pos:1\">complete the first commercial space walk</a>, and travel farther from Earth than any human since the end of the Apollo program.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&quot;Perfect is the enemy of the good. Isaacman checks a lot of boxes,&quot; says Keith Cowing, a former NASA employee and the founder of <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"link\" href=\"https://nasawatch.com/\" data-i13n=\"cpos:6;pos:1\">NASA Watch, a blog dedicated to the agency.</a> &quot;He&#39;s passed every requirement to fly in a spacecraft that American astronauts at NASA are required to pass. He also went out of his way to have a diverse crew, and shove as much science as he could in those missions.&quot;&nbsp;</p><p>And yet if you&#39;re a NASA employee or just someone who cares about the agency&#39;s work, there are still plenty of reasons to be concerned for its future. When Trump first nominated Isaacman in the spring, the billionaire wrote a 62-page document detailing his vision for NASA. In November, <em>Politico</em> <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2025/11/03/jared-isaacman-confidential-manifesto-nasa-00633858\" data-i13n=\"cpos:7;pos:1\">obtained a copy of that plan</a>, titled Project Athena.</p><p>To some insiders, Project Athena painted a picture of someone who, at least at the time when it was written, fundamentally misunderstood how NASA works and how scientific discovery is funded in the US and elsewhere. It also suggests Isaacman may be more open to Trump&#39;s NASA agenda than would appear at first glance.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>When asked about the plan by <em>Politico</em>, one former NASA official characterized it as &quot;bizarre and careless.&quot; Another called it “presumptuous,&quot; given many of the proposed changes to the agency&#39;s structure would require Congressional approval. In one section, Isaacman recommended taking “NASA out of the taxpayer funded climate science business and [leaving] it for academia to determine.” In another section, he promised to evaluate the “relevance and ongoing necessity” of every agency center, particularly NASA&#39;s iconic Jet Propulsion Laboratory, saying the facility and others must increase the “output and time to science KPI.”&nbsp;</p><p>A lot has changed since Isaacman first wrote that document. It came before the workforce cuts, before the <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2025/11/04/science/nasa-goddard-building-closures-government-shutdown\" data-i13n=\"cpos:8;pos:1\">future of Goddard Space Flight Center</a> became uncertain and before Trump surprised everyone by renominating Isaacman. But <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2025/12/03/science/nasa-jared-isaacman-confirmation-hearing\" data-i13n=\"cpos:9;pos:1\">during his Senate testimony</a> earlier this month, the billionaire said “I do stand behind everything in the document, even though it was written seven months ago. I think it was all directionally correct.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>He did appear to distance himself from some viewpoints expressed in or inferred by Project Athena, however. Isaacman stated that “anything suggesting that I am anti-science or want to outsource that responsibility is simply untrue.” He also came out against the administration&#39;s plan to cut NASA&#39;s science budget nearly in half, claiming the proposals would <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"link\" href=\"https://spacenews.com/isaacman-calls-potential-nasa-science-cuts-not-optimal/\" data-i13n=\"cpos:10;pos:1\">not lead to &quot;an optimal outcome.&quot;</a></p><p>One thing is clear, Isaacman is not your typical bureaucrat. &quot;One of the pitfalls of some prior NASA administrators has been that they&#39;ve shown too much reverence for the internal processes and bureaucratic structure of the agency to the detriment of decision-making and performance,&quot; <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.planetary.org/profiles/casey-dreier\" data-i13n=\"cpos:11;pos:1\">said Casey Drier</a>, chief of space policy at <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.planetary.org/\" data-i13n=\"cpos:12;pos:1\">The Planetary Society</a>, a nonprofit that advocates for the exploration and study of space. &quot;Isaacman has positioned himself as the opposite of that. Clearly, that&#39;s something that could lead to a lot of political and congressional challenges if taken too far.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Even if Isaacman doesn&#39;t follow through on any of the proposals made in Project Athena, there&#39;s only so much a NASA administrator — even one sympathetic to civil servants working under them — can do.&nbsp;</p><p>&quot;Once a budget request goes out publicly, everyone in the administration has to defend it. Anything he does will have to be internal and private,&quot; Drier explains. &quot;He never explicitly criticized the administration during his hearing. He&#39;s also coming relatively late in the budget process.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>A lot of NASA&#39;s future will depend on the White House Office of Management and Budget (OMB), which is responsible for implementing the president&#39;s agenda across the executive branch. As a direct result of <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"link\" href=\"https://bipartisanpolicy.org/explainer/what-does-the-updated-omb-circular-a-11-mean-for-how-congress-appropriates-funding/\" data-i13n=\"cpos:13;pos:1\">guidance</a> the OMB issued over the summer, NASA <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.planetary.org/charts/fy-2025-nasas-rate-of-new-grants\" data-i13n=\"cpos:14;pos:1\">awarded 25 percent fewer new grants</a> in 2025 than it did on average between 2020 and 2024.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&quot;The OMB has added layers of requirements that scientists now have to go through to spend the money they&#39;ve already been allocated. The administration has worked against its own stated goals of efficiency,&quot; Drier said. &quot;Isaacman can&#39;t solve that himself. He can&#39;t tell the OMB what to do. That&#39;s going to be a serious challenge.&quot;&nbsp;</p><p>Looming over everything is the fact NASA still does not have a full-year budget for 2026. Congress has until January 30 to fund NASA and the rest of the federal government before the short-term funding bill it passed on November 12 runs out. &quot;On paper, the official policy of the administration is still to terminate a third of NASA&#39;s scientific capability,&quot; Drier points out.</p><p>There are reasons to be cautiously optimistic. Publicly, both the House and Senate have come out against Trump&#39;s funding cuts. And some science missions that were slated to be cancelled, such as <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/osiris-rex-apex-apophis-asteroid-visit-154021788.html\" data-i13n=\"cpos:15;pos:1\">OSIRIS-APEX</a>, have been approved for another full year of operations.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>What NASA needs now is someone who will, as Drier puts it, &quot;vigorously advocate&quot; for the agency in whatever way they can. It remains to be seen if that&#39;s Jared Isaacman.</p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/science/space/nasa-finally-has-a-leader-but-its-future-is-no-more-certain-201109072.html?src=rss",

Instead, think about the types of devices (phones included) that you could see yourself using in the near future. If you’re sure you’ll use iPhones for a long time, an Apple MagSafe-compatible magnetic wireless charger will be faster and more convenient. If you use Android phones or think you might switch sides, however, you’ll want a more universal design. If you have other accessories like wireless earbuds or a smartwatch that supports wireless charging, maybe you’d be better off with a <a data-i13n=\"cpos:7;pos:1\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/computing/accessories/best-multi-device-wireless-charging-pads-120557582.html\">3-in-1 wireless charger</a> or full wireless charging station.</p> <span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span>\n<h2 id=\"jump-link-where-and-how-will-you-use-your-charger\">Where and how will you use your charger?</h2> \n<figure>\n <img src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-02/c9a24a20-b7a0-11ed-b3cd-16d5d607f8d1\" data-uuid=\"5b99f136-c81a-38f1-8f9a-1e8f41fca499\">\n <figcaption></figcaption>\n</figure> \n<p>Odds are that you have a specific use case in mind for your charger. You may want it by your bedside on your nightstand for a quick charge in the morning, or on your desk for at-a-glance notifications. You might even keep it in your bag for convenient travel charging instead of bulky portable chargers or power banks. Think about where you want to use this accessory and what you want to do with the device(s) it charges while it’s powering up. For example, a wireless charging pad might be better for bedside use if you just want to be able to drop your phone down at the end of a long day and know it’ll be powered up in the morning. However, a stand will be better if you have an iPhone and want to make use of the Standby feature during the nighttime hours.</p> \n<p>For a desk wireless charger, a stand lets you more easily glance at phone notifications throughout the day. For traveling, undoubtedly, a puck-style charging pad is best since it will take up much less space in your bag than a stand would. Many power banks also include wireless charging pads built in, so one of those might make even more sense for those who are always on the go. Some foldable chargers are also designed for travel, collapsing flat to take up less space.</p> \n<h2 id=\"jump-link-wireless-charging-performance\">Wireless charging performance</h2> \n<p>Although wireless charging is usually slower than its wired equivalent, speed and wattage are still important considerations. A fast charger can supply enough power for a long night out in the time it takes to change outfits. Look for options that promise faster charging and support standards like Qi2 certified charging for the best balance of efficiency and compatibility.</p> \n<p>In general, a 15W charger is more than quick enough for most situations, and you’ll need a MagSafe-compatible charger to extract that level of performance from an iPhone. With that said, even the slower 7.5W and 10W chargers are fast enough for an overnight power-up. If anything, you’ll want to worry more about support for cases. While many models can deliver power through a reasonably thick case (typically 3mm to 5mm), you’ll occasionally run into examples that only work with naked phones.</p> \n<p>There are some proprietary chargers that smash the 15W barrier if you have the right phone.

Some wireless chargers don’t include power adapters, and others may even ask you to reuse your phone’s USB-C charging cable. What may seem to be a bargain may prove expensive if you have to buy extras just to use it properly. As mentioned above, you’ll want to make sure all of the components needed to use the wireless charger can provide the level of power you need — you’re only as strong (or in this case, fast) as your weakest link.</p> \n<p>Fit and finish is also worth considering. You’re likely going to use your wireless charger every day, so even small differences in build quality could make the difference between joy and frustration. If your charger doesn’t use MagSafe-compatible tech, textured surfaces like fabric or rubberized plastic are more likely to keep your phone in place. The base should be grippy or weighty enough that the charger won’t slide around. Also double check that the wireless charger you’re considering can support phones outfitted with cases — the specifications are usually listed in the charger’s description or specs.</p> \n<p>You’ll also want to think about the minor conveniences. Status lights are useful for indicating correct phone placement, but an overly bright light can be distracting. Ideally, the light dims or shuts off after a certain period of time. And while we caution against lips and trays that limit compatibility, you may still want some barriers to prevent your device falling off its perch on the charging station.</p> \n<h2 id=\"jump-link-wireless-chargers-faqs\">Wireless chargers FAQs</h2> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-do-wireless-chargers-work-if-you-have-a-phone-case\">Do wireless chargers work if you have a phone case?</h3> \n<p>Many wireless chargers do work if you leave the case on your phone. Generally, a case up to 3mm thick should be compatible with most wireless chargers. However, you should check the manufacturer’s guide to ensure a case is supported.</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-how-do-i-know-if-my-phone-supports-wireless-charging\">How do I know if my phone supports wireless charging?</h3> \n<p>Checking the phone’s specification should tell you if your phone is compatible with wireless charging. You might see words like “Qi wireless charging” or “wireless charging compatible.”</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-do-cords-charge-your-phone-faster\">Do cords charge your phone faster?</h3> \n<p>Most often, wired charging will be faster than wireless charging. However, wired charging also depends on what the charging cable’s speed is and how much power it’s designed to carry. A quick-charging cable that can transmit up to 120W of power is going to be faster than a wireless charger.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/computing/accessories/best-wireless-charger-140036359.html?src=rss",

Instead of offering the handheld for $209 until January, Retroid removed the discount in late December, leaving new buyers paying the full retail price of $229. However, the internal specs remained the same, with a Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 processor, up to 12GB of memory and up to 256GB of storage that&#39;s expandable with a TF card slot.</p>\n<p>Despite the hiccups, Retroid looks ready to start shipments of its latest retro gaming handheld as evidenced by the new photos and videos.

And with some incredible new releases this year, we were really eatin’ good. Here are some of the Engadget team’s favorite things we listened to in 2025.</p><h2 id=\"aff7f80e-bda8-4cf9-8dfb-79488507995c\">Spiritbox - <em>Tsunami Sea</em></h2><p>I became aware of Spiritbox in late 2024 shortly before the band dropped its latest album, <em>Tsunami Sea. </em>At the time, I was in a deep Sleep Token phase, and I don’t remember how I stumbled upon Spiritbox, but I’m sure glad I did. Not knowing anything about the band, I initially thought it had two singers: one for clean vocals and another for the harsh, guttural screams.&nbsp;</p><p>Well, I was wrong. Vocalist Courtney LaPlante handles it all, and she is a force of nature. After learning of a new band, I do what any self-respecting music nerd does: I looked up live videos of them on YouTube. The way LaPlante seamlessly transitions from airy, ambient singing to some of the best growls you’ll hear in metal music is effortless. And after seeing Spiritbox live in person earlier in December, I can attest to her ability to consistently nail both vocal styles for the entirety of an hour-long set.&nbsp;</p><p>My infatuation with Spiritbox isn’t just with the vocalist though. Guitarist Mike Stringer, LaPlante’s husband, also has a lot of unique abilities to offer. Stringer’s use of noise and whammy effects in his riffs create a signature style, not to mention his mix of nu-metal, djent and metalcore sensibilities. He also has some of the thickest guitar tones I’ve ever heard live, and I was mesmerized for the full set. Stringer’s guitar work on <em>Tsunami Sea </em>is a prime example of a&nbsp; unique musician at the height of his powers.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Tsunami Sea </em>takes you on a ride. The first two tracks are all-out ragers, and after a slight respite in “Perfect Soul” and “Keep Sweet,” the album’s best song comes fifth. I’ve heard LaPlante dedicate it to “all the people I love to fucking hate,” and it’s clearly written about her enemies. It’s also the perfect example of what this band is capable of. It’s three minutes of LaPlante’s screams interlaced with plenty of Stringer’s trademark guitar work.&nbsp;</p><div><div style=\"left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;\"><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/80VTmBAnTSE?rel=0\" style=\"top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;\" allowfullscreen scrolling=\"no\" data-provider-name=\"youtube\"></iframe></div></div><p>The rest of the album showcases the band’s ability to blend dynamics, with “No Loss, No Love” and “Ride The Wave” providing the highlights on the back half of the record. The album’s title track is a great vehicle for LaPlante’s clean vocals, serving as the introduction to the album’s second act. If you’ve been enamored with Sleep Token this year like I have, give Spiritbox a go — you won’t be sorry you did. — <em>Billy Steele, Deputy Editor, Reviews</em></p><h2 id=\"914d02d0-400b-4c27-8572-6eb6ab5033d6\"><em>Bandsplain</em></h2><p>I didn’t discover <em>Bandsplain </em>in 2025, but I definitely listened to it more than any other podcast in terms of total time spent. Sure, that’s because most episodes are over three hours long, but I digress. Host Yasi Salek does a deep dive on “cult bands and iconic artists” to… ahem, bandsplain why people love them. There’s a deep catalog of back episodes, so there’s sure to be an in-depth analysis of a band you’re familiar with. But even if you think you know an artist, I’m willing to bet Salek will divulge parts of the story you weren’t aware of.&nbsp;</p><p>Jimmy Eat World’s <em>Clarity </em>is a top 5 all-timer for me, and Salek had plenty to offer about the narrative around that album I didn’t know. Her grunge series from 2024 was a history lesson I wish I’d had in middle school when I first discovered Soundgarden, Pearl Jam, Alice in Chains and the rest of the lot. An older episode about Nine Inch Nails served as the primer for me seeing the band live for the first time in September. And that’s the thing about the show: the back catalog holds up. If you’re waiting for the next installment to drop, there’s certainly something in the archives you’ll enjoy.&nbsp;</p><p>No shade to Salek’s colleagues at <em>The Ringer, </em>but the best episodes of <em>Bandsplain </em>are when the guest is a musician. Thursday front man Geoff Rickly was excellent on that Nine Inch Nails episode, and Death Cab for Cutie singer Ben Gibbard had me on the edge of my seat when he was on to discuss The La’s — a band I’d never heard of before. I’d also highly recommend the episodes on Oasis and the more recent one on Alanis Morissette. But, really, you can’t go wrong starting from anywhere on the episode list. <em>— B.S.</em></p><h2 id=\"348e4012-5e93-4889-b389-38394040908a\">Lucy Dacus - <em>Forever is a Feeling</em>&nbsp;</h2><div><div style=\"left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;\"><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/6kRRvhAVZ84?rel=0\" style=\"top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;\" allowfullscreen scrolling=\"no\" data-provider-name=\"youtube\"></iframe></div></div><p>I remember being a teenager and hearing from an adult that they did not religiously seek out, research, evaluate and introduce new bands and songs into their lives as if all existence would cease without the life-sustaining energy of new music. I was confused, concerned and damn sure that wouldn’t happen to me.&nbsp;</p><p>You know where this story goes: Job. Kid. House. Spouse. Pets that will die if I don’t feed, walk, play with and/or medicate them. I allow the algorithm to feed me new songs but rarely does something stick, so I end up listening to tracks I bonded with in my teens and twenties.&nbsp;</p><p>This year, <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"link rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=8662230b-20ea-4e5c-af78-eeacc5a14a34&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=6dcacbf8-c8f4-4944-b5c8-3117aa1edf32&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Instagram&amp;linkText=Blossom+%26+Bones&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5pbnN0YWdyYW0uY29tL2dob3N0cmFuY2htdXNpY2Zlc3RpdmFsLyIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiNmRjYWNiZjgtYzhmNC00OTQ0LWI1YzgtMzExN2FhMWVkZjMyIiwib3JpZ2luYWxVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5pbnN0YWdyYW0uY29tL2dob3N0cmFuY2htdXNpY2Zlc3RpdmFsLyJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAcONAodm2UFPcfTTiIwK541CZC8aehAz0FvMJy73RPFM&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.instagram.com%2Fghostranchmusicfestival%2F\" data-i13n=\"elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Instagram;elmt:;cpos:2;pos:1\" data-original-link=\"https://www.instagram.com/ghostranchmusicfestival/\">Blossom &amp; Bones</a>, a three-day music festival in Ghost Ranch, New Mexico, managed to push through the churn and lodge new music into my brain. Along with my kid and some friends, I camped among some of the most beautiful landscapes imaginable and ambled over to the stage each evening for performances by Santigold, Ani DiFranco and about a dozen more.&nbsp;</p><p>Lucy Dacus, one third of the indie group Boygenius, did a one-hour set with plenty of songs from her latest album <em>Forever is a Feeling</em>. Hearing the songs for the first time, I felt like I’d been listening to them for years. Lilting harmonies and layered strings create a lovely backdrop for Dacus’s velvet voice, but there’s a sharpness to her observations about relationships, rejection and sex. I’ve been looping the album ever since. — <em>Amy Skorheim, Senior Reporter, Buying Advice</em></p><h2 id=\"357a8d1c-06b2-49ae-899f-9822adf82782\">Blanco White - “So Certain” (single)</h2><div><div style=\"left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;\"><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/8skj1w1XdFc?rel=0\" style=\"top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;\" allowfullscreen scrolling=\"no\" data-provider-name=\"youtube\"></iframe></div></div><p>Early on the last concert of the day at that same festival, Blanco White took the stage. People were aimlessly milling about and the sun hadn’t yet set. Kids were playing on the lawn and the smell from the food trucks was intense, but I was enrapt by the four people on stage. The sad violin and strummy guitars floated with the hand-beat drum out into the red hills. The music sounded like I felt: rooted and wrapped in the harsh beauty of the desert and I was really glad to take that home with me. <em>— A.S.</em></p><h2 id=\"75068a5c-9263-40b8-bf74-fdd93ea57a88\"><em>Martian Revolution&nbsp;</em></h2><p>If you&#39;re as big a nerd as I am, you might know that Leo Tolstoy didn&#39;t consider <em>War and Peace </em>to be a novel. The story is what most people read for, but in the author&#39;s mind, all the drama was a parable to illustrate his grand theory of history.</p><p>Over the last year, history podcaster Mike Duncan has accomplished a similar feat using a medium Tolstoy never imagined. Duncan&#39;s <em>Revolutions </em>podcast has covered ten different revolutionary upheavals across history, starting with the English Civil War and ending with the Russian Revolution. After wrapping up the Bolsheviks, Duncan took a few episodes to suggest a grand theory of how revolutions unfold. For a while, it seemed like that was all we&#39;d get. Then, in the middle of 2024, he started posting original sci-fi — without any indication that this tale, which followed future Martians revolting against their corporate overlords on Earth, was in any way different from the previous ten seasons.</p><p>Part of what makes the Martian Revolution so excellent is Duncan&#39;s deadpan delivery. He never once breaks character. He rattles off lists of fictional sources, apologizes for inaccuracies in prior episodes, and introduces made-up historical figures with the same gravity he once used to mention George Washington or Simon Bolivar. If you&#39;re a fan of <em>Revolutions, </em>you&#39;ll have a blast recognizing character archetypes. (Mabel Dore is the Liberal Noble! Timothy Werner is the Man of Blood!)</p><p>But the podcast is great even if you&#39;ve never listened to an episode of <em>Revolutions. </em>It has an excellent grasp of character and a sense of inevitable tragedy, but with moments of joy leavened throughout. I certainly hope we don&#39;t wind up in the megacorp-ruled future of the podcast, but if we do, it&#39;ll be a great consolation if it eventually turns out the way Duncan imagines.<em> — Sam Chapman, Senior Writer</em></p><h2 id=\"d1b2cc8f-a744-49b9-97f1-0e132570b47a\">Ron Gallo - <em>Checkmate</em>&nbsp;</h2><div><div style=\"left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;\"><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/MUc44nDVkNk?rel=0\" style=\"top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;\" allowfullscreen scrolling=\"no\" data-provider-name=\"youtube\"></iframe></div></div><p>My favorite artists are ones that surprise me, and Ron Gallo is a master of reinvention. He&#39;s dabbled in absurdist punk, psychedelia, garage rock, Beatles-tinged pop and, now, stripped-down acoustic music. This is not a genre I am typically a fan of, Elliott Smith withstanding, but <em>Checkmate</em> is something special. His lyrical prowess is off the charts here, trading his usual wordplay for simple and emotionally-gutting truisms about life, love and, well, the end of the world.&nbsp;</p><p>Of course, the lyrics wouldn&#39;t work if the songs weren&#39;t good. The songs are very good. The title track is just about the perfect love song, with a primary hook that gets lost in your head for weeks. Other tracks offer hints of Mac DeMarco, Dan Fogelberg, Kevin Morby and just about everyone else who has crafted great songs on an acoustic guitar. It&#39;s fitting that Gallo has found a home on the label Kill Rock Stars, which released so much of Elliott Smith&#39;s work back in the day. As an aside, Gallo regularly posts songs about current events on TikTok and other social media platforms, which are worth checking out if you like stuff like Jesse Welles. <em>— Lawrence Bonk, Contributing Reporter</em></p><h2 id=\"045e5129-981d-4dec-bee9-43aa358ff3b1\">De La Soul -<em> Cabin in the Sky</em></h2><div><div style=\"left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;\"><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/TQWm1hfju3Q?rel=0\" style=\"top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;\" allowfullscreen scrolling=\"no\" data-provider-name=\"youtube\"></iframe></div></div><p>There have been hip-hop albums that explored the finality and tragedy of death, but not many that truly tackled spirituality and long-term grief. De La Soul has done just that, following the passing of founding member Trugoy the Dove. This album serves as a final testament of sorts for Trugoy, as he&#39;s heavily featured throughout. In that way, <em>Cabin in the Sky</em> is reminiscent of A Tribe Called Quest&#39;s 2016 masterpiece <em>We Got It from Here... Thank You 4 Your Service</em>, which followed the death of rapper Phife Dawg.&nbsp;</p><p>Like Tribe&#39;s modern classic, <em>Cabin in the Sky</em> is filled with absolute bangers. It features standout beats by DJ Premier, Pete Rock, Trugoy, Jake One and others. The rhymes are great and all three primary De La members are given time to shine. Guest rappers like Common and Nas got the memo, delivering some of their most memorable verses in years. Heck, even Giancarlo Esposito is on board as the narrator. Some reviewers have dinged this album for being too long but, come on, that&#39;s like complaining there&#39;s too much pizza. It&#39;s De La Soul. <em>— L.B.</em></p><h2 id=\"a717515e-90c3-4e2f-9d84-9de305a72856\">FKA twigs - <em>Eusexua</em></h2><div><div style=\"left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;\"><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/KnGSVIZGkQo?rel=0\" style=\"top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;\" allowfullscreen scrolling=\"no\" data-provider-name=\"youtube\"></iframe></div></div><p>This was a really good year for new music IMO, so much that I&#39;ve been finding it pretty difficult to think back and settle on my favorite releases. But, FKA twigs&#39; <em>Eusexua</em> undeniably did some heavy lifting for me, pretty much carrying me through the first six or so months of the year without much competition, and I&#39;ve circled right back to it as the year closes. It&#39;s an album that somehow seems to meet every vibe. It&#39;ll have you in club mode and ready for a night of sweaty, filthy dancing in under three minutes, or feeling bright and upbeat like a midday walk on the first day of spring — yet it still hits when you&#39;re having a good ol&#39; car cry.&nbsp;</p><p>&quot;Girl Feels Good&quot; is for sure one of my most-played songs of the year, followed closely by &quot;Eusexua,&quot; &quot;Perfect Stranger,&quot; &quot;Keep It, Hold It&quot; and &quot;Striptease.&quot; If ever I can&#39;t decide what I&#39;m in the mood to listen to, I throw this album on and it doesn&#39;t disappoint.<em> — Cheyenne MacDonald, Weekend Editor</em></p><h2 id=\"121a7e44-5a35-427e-8ab3-8861f5b4f8e9\">Faetooth - <em>Labyrinthine</em>&nbsp;</h2><div><div style=\"left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;\"><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/q6prtDY9fQQ?rel=0\" style=\"top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;\" allowfullscreen scrolling=\"no\" data-provider-name=\"youtube\"></iframe></div></div><p>Faetooth&#39;s sophomore album, <em>Labyrinthine</em>, is face-melting, melancholic perfection. The band describes its sound as &quot;fairy doom,&quot; but don&#39;t let that first word fool you into thinking it isn&#39;t heavy as hell. <em>Labyrinthine</em> goes unbelievably hard, and will have you feeling like you&#39;re eternally wandering a cursed bog, surrounded by the wailing of the unfortunate souls who came before you. Don&#39;t believe me? Put on &quot;White Noise.&quot; This is really an album that should be enjoyed in its entirety, though, and I can&#39;t individually name half the songs on it because I tend to just keep the whole thing playing on rotation. <em>— C.M.&nbsp;</em></p><h2 id=\"50e847e0-53c8-4c3e-8d0b-af387419732d\">Orville Peck - <em>Appaloosa</em>&nbsp;</h2><div><div style=\"left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;\"><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/-Q0wlv9CRKw?rel=0\" style=\"top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;\" allowfullscreen scrolling=\"no\" data-provider-name=\"youtube\"></iframe></div></div><p>This EP is truly a testament to my ability to run my obsessions into the ground, because it only came out in mid-November and somehow landed on my most-listened wrapup for the end of the year… which was released some two weeks later. It&#39;s front-loaded with its strongest songs, a powerful and kind of haunting trio that just flows beautifully from one into the other: &quot;Dreaded Sundown,&quot; to &quot;Drift Away&quot; into &quot;Atchafalaya&quot; (ft. Noah Cyrus). As a fan of musicals, I also loved the inclusion of &quot;Maybe This Time,&quot; a cover from <em>Cabaret</em>, especially since I was pretty bummed to have missed Peck&#39;s stint as the Emcee in <em>Cabaret</em> on Broadway this summer. <em>— C.M.</em></p><h2 id=\"f81e58b3-82cd-4f8f-8669-362bf94f0357\"><em>Case 63&nbsp;</em></h2><p>I got into an audio series kick this year, and dove into shows like <em>Unicorn Girl</em>, <em>Stalked!</em> and more. But none of the dramatized fiction I listened to in 2025 had me hooked like <em>Case 63</em>. Setting aside that it’s voice-acted by A-listers Julianne Moore and Oscar Isaac, which is a phenomenal pairing that won me over on star power alone. The best thing about <em>Case 63</em> is its storytelling.&nbsp;</p><p>Moore stars as a psychologist, meeting Isaac for the first time in a prison interview. Isaac has been claiming to be a traveler of sorts, and through recorded sessions and voice notes, we hear his side of the story, as well as her reactions and ultimate involvement in the adventures. Every step of the way, particularly in the beginning, there is clear explanation as to why the exchange is being recorded. It isn’t necessary, but it’s helpful in my buying into the realism of the story.&nbsp;</p><p>It isn’t just the method and technical aspects of the storytelling, of course. Narratively, <em>Case 63</em> is a gripping ride, and thanks to its short episodes, it’s easy to binge really quickly. There is certainly a generous use of cliffhangers to help speed things along, but I found myself eager to devour the entire series in one commute. The story continued to linger in my mind days after I finished both existing seasons, and I’m hoping the new one drops soon. If you’re looking for a quick and easy sci-fi audio series, do not miss <em>Case 63</em>. —<em> Cherlynn Low, Managing Editor</em></p><h2 id=\"64a4d5af-a325-4bf8-92e0-ec7d8cfac840\"><em>Secure Love&nbsp;</em></h2><p>I spent a lot of time this year trying to learn more about my attachment style and how it shows up in all the relationships in my life. Between Stephanie Rigg’s <em>On Attachment</em> podcast, the TV show <em>Couples Therapy</em> and all the books on the topic of attachment styles, trauma and more, I’ve consumed them all. And while they’ve all been helpful in different ways, one podcast stuck out to me this year. It’s hosted by Julie Menanno, MA, LMFT, LCPC, creator of the <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"link rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=8662230b-20ea-4e5c-af78-eeacc5a14a34&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=6dcacbf8-c8f4-4944-b5c8-3117aa1edf32&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Instagram&amp;linkText=%40TheSecureRelationship&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5pbnN0YWdyYW0uY29tL3RoZXNlY3VyZXJlbGF0aW9uc2hpcC8iLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjZkY2FjYmY4LWM4ZjQtNDk0NC1iNWM4LTMxMTdhYTFlZGYzMiIsIm9yaWdpbmFsVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuaW5zdGFncmFtLmNvbS90aGVzZWN1cmVyZWxhdGlvbnNoaXAvIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAaevBNsYgk_rLmPM5tqcXE7ThzNWozvwhS8t6tIFTIhF&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.instagram.com%2Fthesecurerelationship%2F\" data-i13n=\"elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Instagram;elmt:;cpos:3;pos:1\" data-original-link=\"https://www.instagram.com/thesecurerelationship/\">@TheSecureRelationship</a> account on Instagram and the author of <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"link rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;itemId=amazon_1668012863&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=6dcacbf8-c8f4-4944-b5c8-3117aa1edf32&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;linkText=Secure+Love%3A+Create+a+relationship+that+lasts+a+lifetime&amp;custData=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&amp;signature=AQAAAbCQbf932ToPk1w2G5ARGlPo4C2APtqGjwwBO9Uc7pek&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FSecure-Love-Create-Relationship-Lifetime%2Fdp%2F1668012863\" data-i13n=\"elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:;cpos:4;pos:1\" data-original-link=\"https://www.amazon.com/Secure-Love-Create-Relationship-Lifetime/dp/1668012863\"><em>Secure Love: Create a relationship that lasts a lifetime</em></a>.&nbsp;</p><p>You can probably tell from that introduction what Menanno’s work is all about.

Each season of the podcast (it’s partway through the second as of this writing) sees Menanno work with one couple through their negative cycles, using somatic practices to help each partner understand their emotions, triggers and reactions. Because we’re listening to real people talk about real-life happenings, it’s not only easy to relate, but listeners often see themselves in these scenarios. At the start of each episode, too, Menanno reads out or plays notes from the audience, and you can see how fellow listeners have reacted.&nbsp;</p><p>This season, for example, my friend and some other listeners seemed to really dislike Brian, the anxious male partner in this season’s pair. While I’ve certainly found some of Brian’s ways of speaking borderline offensive, I had a lot more sympathy for him as I started seeing his traits in my loved ones. I also started to identify with his partner Bethany, who Menanno typed as having an avoidant attachment style.&nbsp;</p><p>As I listened to Bethany and Brian describe the reasons they got into fights and explain where they were coming from, suddenly it felt like the world made sense. I saw similar patterns and reasonings in my own relationship, as well as those of my parents, relatives and friends.&nbsp;</p><p>It is slightly voyeuristic to listen to something so intimate, of course, but Menanno makes it all educational rather than just entertaining. She gently interrupts parts of each episode to tell the audience why she asks certain questions or what she’s attempting to achieve by asking Brian or Bethany to sit with their difficult feelings.&nbsp;</p><p>I found her method familiar, as I recently started working with a somatic coach whose approach is similar to Menanno’s, which is rooted in emotion-focused therapy (EFT). Staying with uncomfortable feelings makes me want to jump out of my skin, but being able to endure them, question why they arise and then understand where they come from is crucial to helping uncover the thinking that causes them. Sometimes they’re the result of flawed logic, catastrophic thinking or a simple lack of context, but often they’re very reasonable reactions.&nbsp;</p><p>If you’re looking to understand yourself and your emotions a bit better, or just want to get an idea of what EFT or couples therapy sounds like, I can’t recommend <em>The Secure Love Podcast</em> highly enough. <em>— C.L.</em></p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/music/what-we-listened-to-in-2025-201308584.html?src=rss",

Whether it&#39;s a slim folio case, an Apple Pencil, a docking station or a paper-like screen protector, there are so many iPad accessories out there that can transform how you use your tablet on a regular basis — and make your iPad last longer, too.

There are a couple of ways to do this: first, you can check the back of your tablet for its model number, which will start with an “A” and end with a series of numbers. You can also go into Settings on your iPad, then General and look up the model number in the top section. If you see a series of letters and numbers with a slash (“/“) in it, just tap that to reveal the iPad’s true model number.</p> <span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span>\n<p>The most important iPad details to consider before buying accessories are the charging port, screen size and Apple Pencil compatibility. Most iPads now have USB-C charging, save for the now discontinued 9th-gen iPad that still requires a Lightning cable.

They pull double-duty: Not only do they act as a first line of defense if your iPad goes careening onto concrete, but they can also enhance the digital drawing and writing experience. Using a stylus on an iPad is strange at first because gliding the stylus nib over a glass surface feels nothing like “normal” writing. Matte screen protectors can get closer to replicating the pen-on-paper experience, and they also prevent the stylus nib from wearing down as quickly.</p> \n<p>\n <core-commerce id=\"096ee51d507446e58275b58455543392\" data-type=\"product-list\" data-original-url=\"https://www.amazon.com/PaperLike-Pieces-iPad-2020-10-9/dp/B0BJKQ4T6B?ref_=ast_sto_dp&amp;th=1&amp;psc=1\"></core-commerce></p> \n<p>\n <core-commerce id=\"13f27d1d0d444247a1da1671b1c13aff\" data-type=\"product-list\" data-original-url=\"https://www.amazon.com/BELLEMOND-SET-Protector-compatible-WIPD129PLK/dp/B08JFXGMD7?th=1\"></core-commerce></p> \n<p>\n <core-commerce id=\"8b17ec92ec5e413a85bd60479a04b134\" data-type=\"product-list\" data-original-url=\"https://pen.tips/collections/products/products/penmat?variant=43000769544439\"></core-commerce></p> \n<p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/computing/accessories/best-ipad-accessories-130018595.html?src=rss",

There&#39;s a 39-inch OLED (39GX950B) that includes the aforementioned AI upscaling to 5K, but also algorithms for scene optimization and sound. The company says this will &quot;refine images and audio performance for a more immersive audiovisual experience.&quot;</p>\n<p>This monitor can easily switch from the standard resolution with a refresh rate of 165Hz to a much zippier WFHD resolution with a refresh rate of 330Hz. This is supported by a 0.03ms response time.

This display has been &quot;designed to dramatically improve blooming control&quot;, which is done by minimizing halo effects and stuffing in 2,304 local dimming zones. LG promises it &quot;preserves fine details across bright and dark scenes alike.&quot;</p>\n<p>This one features AI algorithms for upscaling to 5K, scene optimization and sound. It can also switch between 165Hz at 5K and 330Hz at QHD, with a 1ms response time. The screen boasts a peak brightness of 1,250 nits.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-12/03ac5070-e279-11f0-bdd6-6003f9c9164c\" data-crop-orig-src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-12/03ac5070-e279-11f0-bdd6-6003f9c9164c\" style=\"height:1226px;width:2200px;\" alt=\"A display.\" data-uuid=\"956ff9d8-04b6-348a-93c3-2f089ed869a4\"><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">LG</div></figure>\n<p>Finally, there&#39;s the beastly 52-inch (52G930B) large-format gaming display.

The 1000R curvature wraps around the peripheral, which should be great for flying sims and stuff like that.</p>\n<p>LG hasn&#39;t released any information as to when we&#39;ll be able to get our mitts on these displays, or how much they will cost.

The move is intended to reduce the risk of collisions, putting the satellites in a region that&#39;s <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/theres-no-easy-answer-to-being-a-space-janitor-170011469.html\" data-i13n=\"cpos:2;pos:1\">less cluttered</a> and will allow them to deorbit more quickly should an incident occur.&nbsp;</p><p>&quot;Lowering the satellites results in condensing Starlink orbits, and will increase space safety in several ways,&quot; Nicolls wrote, also pointing to the coming solar minimum — a period in the sun&#39;s 11ish-year cycle when activity is lower — as one of the reasons for the move. The next solar minimum is expected to occur in the early 2030s. &quot;As solar minimum approaches, atmospheric density decreases which means the ballistic decay time at any given altitude increases - lowering will mean a &gt;80% reduction in ballistic decay time in solar minimum, or 4+ years reduced to a few months,&quot; Nicolls wrote.</p><figure><img src=\"https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/Screenshot_2026-01-01_at_9.48.02%E2%80%AFPM.jpg\" data-crop-orig-src=\"https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/Screenshot_2026-01-01_at_9.48.02%E2%80%AFPM.jpg\" style=\"height:1398px;width:1296px;\" alt=\"A screenshot of the X post by Starlink VP of engineering Michael Nicolls \" data-uuid=\"dba03a94-e10d-4521-a7eb-a02873d74bc1\"/><figcaption>A screenshot of an X post by Starlink VP of engineering Michael Nicolls announcing that satellites orbiting at around 500 kilometers will be lowered to 480km</figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\"></div></figure><p>The announcement comes a few weeks after Starlink said one of its satellites had <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/science/space/a-starlink-satellite-just-exploded-and-left-trackable-debris-120002814.html\" data-i13n=\"cpos:3;pos:1\">experienced an anomaly</a> that created some debris and sent it tumbling.

    "body": "<p>Samsung has upgraded its Freestyle portable projector for 2026. The company announced a new model, the Freestyle+, ahead of CES, touting twice the brightness of its predecessor at 430 ISO lumens, and AI-powered screen optimization features. As with Freestyles past, the Freestyle+ offers 180-degree rotation and 360-degree audio. This one also supports Q-Symphony so it&#39;ll work with some Samsung soundbars. Samsung hasn&#39;t revealed much else in the way of specs or pricing, but it&#39;ll be showing off the Freestyle+ at CES 2026, so we&#39;re likely to learn more details soon.&nbsp;</p><p>While previous iterations of Samsung&#39;s compact projector offered automatic screen adjustment features, like auto focus and auto leveling, the Freestyle+ uses AI to take optimization a step further. With AI OptiScreen, as the company is calling it, the projector offers 3D auto keystone to fix distortion on uneven or non-flat surfaces, real-time focus when the projector is moved, automatic screen fit for compatible accessories and wall calibration to reduce visual distractions from the projection surface. It&#39;ll also support Samsung&#39;s Vision AI Companion.&nbsp;</p><p>The company hasn&#39;t announced a specific release date yet for the new projector, but says it&#39;s targeting the first half of the year. It&#39;ll be released in phases globally.&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/home/home-theater/samsungs-latest-freestyle-portable-projector-is-brighter-and-smarter-014026804.html?src=rss",

It&#39;s a vertically expandable 18.1-inch large display, and passengers can even watch videos without being visible to the driver.</p>\n<p>Hyundai Mobis collaborated with German optics specialist Zeiss to develop the &quot;world&#39;s first system to utilize holographic film to transform the entire front windshield into an ultra-large display surface.&quot; It says it will begin mass production in 2029, so don&#39;t expect to see this on the market anytime soon.</p>\n<p>Beyond automotive, though, we&#39;ll also get a first-ever look at the company&#39;s new Atlas robot.

Ahead of the business&#39; upcoming appearance at CES, we&#39;ve learned a bit about what Airloom has accomplished this year and what it is aiming for next.</p><p>Rather than the very tall towers typically used for this approach, Airloom&#39;s structures are 20 to 30 meters high. They are comprised of a loop of adjustable wings that move along a track, a design that’s akin to a roller coaster. As the wings move, they generate power just like the blades on a regular wind turbine do. Airloom claims that its structures require 40 percent less mass than a traditional one while delivering the same output. It also says the Airloom&#39;s towers require 42 percent fewer parts and 96 percent fewer unique parts. In combination, the company says its approach is 85 percent faster to deploy and 47 percent less expensive than horizontal axis wind turbines. Airloom broke ground on a pilot site in June for testing out its approach and confirming how those figures work in practice. </p><p>It’s not feasible to bring a wind farm, even a small one, into CES, but Airloom will have a booth at the event with materials about its technology and engineering. While the business isn&#39;t in a consumer-facing field, the impact of Airloom&#39;s work could have a future positive impact on people if the data center boom continues.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/science/airloom-will-showcase-its-new-approach-to-wind-power-at-ces-160000063.html?src=rss",

    "title": "In 2025, quitting social media felt easier than ever",
    "body": "<p>For a tech writer, being very offline is sort of like being a marathon coach who doesn’t run. So in 2025, I tried to reverse years of studied avoidance towards the most ubiquitous technological phenomenon on earth —  I got back on social media. The change was short-lived.&nbsp;</p><p>My first exodus from the feeds took some work — disabling notifications, removing apps from my homescreen and then deleting accounts entirely. This time, the phone put itself down. The whole thing has simply lost its luster.</p><p>I started with Instagram. Every experience went like this: I’d see a single post from one of the rare family members or IRL friends who are active on the platform. Next, I was fed a sponsored post, followed by suggestions to follow randos. After that, a series of influencer videos that, admittedly, appeal to my taste (funny/absurdist women and dissertations on urban planning). That was followed up with more sponsored posts, mostly from brands I’d looked up for work. Then it’d circle back to the influencers. My eyes glazed over and I tossed the phone aside.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Years back, the platform gave off a jolt of quasi-social connection that I’d spend hours sucking up. I fed on pointless thoughts from an ex-coworker, vacation reels from a college roommate, a half-baked loaf of bread that an old friend dropped on the floor but took a picture of anyway. Now it’s a bare sliver of that stuff, shoehorned between towers of sponsored content and posts from people who make or promote their living on Instagram. The real people have left. The connection is gone. The FOMO is no more.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>I experienced some variation of the same disappointment on every platform I rejoined. When I got back on TikTok a few months <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/social-media/tiktok-is-back-in-apples-app-store-in-the-us-014013369.html\" data-i13n=\"cpos:1;pos:1\">after the ban</a>, it felt like a frenzied shopping mall. Every video seems to be about four seconds long and most are promotional and/or shoppable. YouTube Shorts is drowning in AI-generated videos, and I don’t hit up social media to watch fake footage of desperate wild animal babies clambering onto the boats of helpful humans. My life has no need for simulated toddlers admonishing their pets. Occasionally, I’d hit on something compelling: a clip from late night TV, a stupidly decadent dessert recipe, people from other countries explaining cultural subtleties.&nbsp;</p><p>But for me, these social media platforms are no longer velcro for the eyes. I remember losing focus, spending long hours on YouTube Shorts and IG. I’d look up bleary-eyed and shame-faced after hours scrolling TikTok’s For You Page. Now, after a few minutes, a bored ickiness sets in. I feel like I’m trapped in a carnival of bots hawking shampoo at me and I just want to go home.&nbsp;</p><p>It’s not a mystery how or why things feel different; The answer is always money. These billion- and trillion-dollar companies have shareholders who prize year-over-year performance over anything else. So we get more sponsored posts on Instagram.

The fact that I can’t connect with my fellow common people using their services is not surprising. The change isn’t even driving everyone away. Instagram reported more users than ever this year, to the tune of <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/social-media/instagram-reaches-3-billion-monthly-users-160554420.html\" data-i13n=\"cpos:11;pos:1\">35 percent of the planet</a>. Billions of users still scroll TikTok and watch YouTube Shorts. So maybe it’s just a me thing.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>And I have options. Over-monetization may have made me not want to engage with a few social media behemoths, but things aren’t so dire everywhere. Bluesky reminds me of Twitter before X. I take comfort in seeing posts that prove most people are as dismayed as I am over a government and wider economic system that are nakedly uninterested in serving the public. The hot takes aren’t quite as funny as they were on Twitter years back — maybe it’s just all been said before or perhaps things have gotten too dire for levity. I still don’t end up spending a lot of time on the platform, however. It’s not as weird as it was before <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/social-media/bluesky-surges-to-15-million-users-after-getting-a-million-sign-ups-in-one-week-224213573.html\" data-i13n=\"cpos:12;pos:1\">the defection</a> and I get tired of the stream of news headlines contextualized with tut-tutting and handwringing — I’m perfectly capable of doing that myself.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>It’d be easy to say that social media just isn’t my thing, but that’s not true because I can’t quit Reddit — the shining exception to my social media ennui. It feels filled with actual people. Ads exist, but in a subdued, manageable way. And every contributor, commenter and moderator I’ve come across on the app is militantly vigilant against the onslaught of artificially generated content. I also like the organizational structure. I know my Home tab will only expose me to my chosen subs and I derive great joy from happy cows, greeble-chasing cats, enigmatic night feelings and freaky abandoned spaces. I use my local subreddit r/Albuquerque daily to answer questions and keep tabs on the world (directly) around me.&nbsp;</p><p>Sadly, Reddit is an outlier, a misfit exception to the rule, and now that it’s gone <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/reddit-is-now-a-publicly-traded-company-144455403.html\" data-i13n=\"cpos:13;pos:1\">public</a>, it may follow a <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/social-media/reddit-puts-its-plans-for-paid-subreddits-on-hold-181455933.html\" data-i13n=\"cpos:14;pos:1\">similar monetization</a> push. Bluesky is tiny, new and not <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.pcmag.com/news/bluesky-figuring-out-how-to-make-money-without-spamming-you-with-ads\" data-i13n=\"cpos:15;pos:1\">yet profitable</a>, so who knows where its financial journey will lead it (though the “<a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"\" class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/bluesky-made-more-money-selling-160957010.html\" data-i13n=\"cpos:16;pos:1\">world without Caesars</a>” shirt gives us some hope).&nbsp;</p><p>There’s something lamentable about the loss of the connections we gleaned from platforms that were once compelling, engrossing and rife with the creativity of our fellow humans. Ultimately, any public-facing company that prioritizes profits over everything else has no incentive to look out for its users. So I don’t expect any of the larger social platforms to pull back on their monetization marches. For now, I’ve decided I’m comfortable with my admittedly narrow interaction with the world of social media. As a Gen-Xer, online-first wasn’t how my relationship to the world started out. And I’m pretty confident I know enough about other tech-related stuff to be useful to my editors and readers without a black belt in social.

For instance, that AI-powered car cockpit mentioned above will feature integrations with both Microsoft and NVIDIA. For instance, Bosch is touting the ability to use voice commands to join a Teams call, while the car&#39;s system will automatically activate adaptive cruise control. And it&#39;s noting that NVIDIA&#39;s software suites will help manage &quot;real-time sensor processing and vision-language models.&quot;</p>\n<p>Here&#39;s a glimpse of what the booth will look like:</p>\n<div id=\"7ca51c2098ca46a8be89fc6789ffeab8\"><div style=\"left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;\"><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/C9tKL1jFBe8?rel=0&amp;start=36\" style=\"top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;\" allowfullscreen scrolling=\"no\" data-embed-domain=\"www.youtube.com\"></iframe></div></div>\n<p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/how-to-watch-the-bosch-ces-2026-press-conference-live-130020898.html?src=rss",

If you’re looking to alter your body shape, that figure could go up as your waistline goes down since muscle weighs more than fat.</p> <span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span>\n<p>Some scales go further by providing additional metrics like visceral fat levels, giving you a more comprehensive picture of your health. Dr. Anne Swift, Director of Public Health teaching at the University of Cambridge, said “weighing yourself too often can result in [you] becoming fixated on small fluctuations day-to-day rather than the overall trend over time.” Swift added “it’s sometimes better to focus on how clothes fit, or how you feel, rather than your weight.”</p> \n<p>A meta-analysis from <a data-i13n=\"cpos:6;pos:1\" href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26742706/\">2016</a> found there may be some negative psychological impact from self weighing. A <a data-i13n=\"cpos:7;pos:1\" href=\"https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/circ.138.suppl_1.10962\">2018 study</a>, however, said there may be a positive correlation between regular weigh-ins and accelerated weight loss. It can be a minefield and I’d urge you to take real care of yourself and remember success won’t happen overnight.</p> \n<h2 id=\"jump-link-best-smart-scales-for-2026\">Best smart scales for 2026</h2> \n<p>\n <core-commerce id=\"55f3e395d8e045399b07c9d7af9846d2\" data-type=\"product-list\" data-original-url=\"https://www.amazon.com/Fitbit-FB203BK-Bluetooth-Digital-Weight/dp/B07VV6GKDS\"></core-commerce></p> \n<p>\n <core-commerce id=\"a5989e4ee75340c09e62ebcccf292e40\" data-type=\"product-list\" data-original-url=\"https://www.amazon.com/eufy-Intelligent-Bluetooth-16-Measurement-Multi-Modes/dp/B0BRBZRTM2/\"></core-commerce></p> \n<p>\n <core-commerce id=\"affb9482d05c466385eb81b42f862de2\" data-type=\"product-list\" data-original-url=\"https://www.amazon.com/Garmin-Wireless-Connectivity-Measure-Muscle/dp/B08JQPRNVX\"></core-commerce></p> \n<p>\n <core-commerce id=\"7bed6c983d074ffdbc46ebe488671713\" data-type=\"product-list\" data-original-url=\"https://www.amazon.com/WITHINGS-Body-Comp-Bluetooth-Compatible/dp/B0C34ZWCXH/\"></core-commerce></p> \n<h2 id=\"jump-link-what-to-look-for-in-a-smart-scale\">What to look for in a smart scale</h2> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-weight\">Weight</h3> \n<p>A scale that measures weight is probably the top requirement, right? Whether you&#39;re after a basic weight scale or a full-featured body fat scale, bear in mind, with all these measurements, the readings won’t be as accurate as a calibrated clinical scale. It’s better to focus on the overall trend, up or down over time, rather than a single measurement in isolation. Scales offering high-precision measurements can help, especially if you’re looking at the data to inform a specific health or fitness goal.</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-connectivity\">Connectivity</h3> \n<p>Before you buy your scale, work out how you’re planning on weighing yourself and when, as it is an issue. Some lower-end smart bathroom scales connect via Bluetooth and have no internal storage, so if you don’t have your phone to hand, it won’t record your weight. If your scale has Wi-Fi, then your scale can post the data to a server, letting you access them from any compatible device. Also, you should be mindful that some smart scales aren’t built with security in mind, so there’s a small risk to your privacy should your scale be compromised.</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-bone-density\">Bone density</h3> \n<p>The stronger your bones are, the less risk you have of breaks and osteoporosis — common concerns as you get older. Clinical bone density tests use low-power x-rays and some scales can offer you an at-home approximation. These bone mass tests pass a small electrical current through your feet, measuring the resistance as it completes its journey. The resistance offered by bones, fat and muscle are all different, letting your scale identify the difference. A body composition monitor often includes this feature, too, providing a detailed breakdown of bone density, fat and muscle mass.</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-body-fat-percentage-and-muscle-mass\">Body fat percentage and muscle mass</h3> \n<p>Fat and muscle are necessary parts of our makeup, but too much of either can be problematic. Much like bone density, a body composition measurement feature can monitor your body fat and muscle mass percentages using Bioelectrical Impedance Analysis (BIA). This measurement tests how well your body resists an electrical signal passing through your body. (It’s a rough rule of thumb you should have a 30/70 percent split between fat and muscle, but please consult a medical professional for figures specific to your own body and medical needs.) For those with specific athletic goals, smart scales offer an athlete mode to better tailor readings for accuracy. If body fat monitoring is a priority, look for a model marketed as a body fat scale.</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-bmi\">BMI</h3> \n<p>A lot of scales offer a BMI calculation, and it’s easy to do since you just plot height and weight on a set graph line. Body Mass Index is, however, a problematic measurement that its critics say is both <a data-i13n=\"cpos:8;pos:1\" href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2930234/\">overly simplistic</a> and often <a data-i13n=\"cpos:9;pos:1\" href=\"https://www.pennmedicine.org/news/news-releases/2013/august/obesitymortality-paradox-demon\">greatly misleading</a>. Unfortunately, it’s also one of the most common clinical body metrics and medical professionals will use it to make judgements about your care.</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-pulse-wave-velocity\">Pulse Wave Velocity</h3> \n<p>French health-tech company Withings has offered Pulse Wave Velocity (PWV) on its flagship scale for some time, although regulatory concerns meant it was withdrawn for a period. It’s a measurement of arterial stiffness, which acts as a marker both of cardiovascular risk and other health conditions. For those looking for an even deeper understanding of their health, some scales now offer a body scan, which provides more advanced metrics such as segmental body composition and vascular health insights.</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-wearables-and-integration\">Wearables and integration</h3> \n<p>Pairing your smart scale with wearables like <a data-i13n=\"cpos:10;pos:1\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/wearables/best-fitness-trackers-133053484.html\">fitness trackers</a> or <a data-i13n=\"cpos:11;pos:1\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/best-smartwatches-153013118.html\">smartwatches</a> can further enhance your health-tracking ecosystem. Many smart scales sync directly with platforms like Fitbit or Apple Health, making it easier to track trends and analyze your data in one place.</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-display\">Display</h3> \n<p>Less a specification and more a note: Smart bathroom scales have displays ranging from pre-printed LCDs or digital dot matrix layouts through to color display screens. On the high end, your scale display can show you trending charts for your weight and other vital statistics, and can even tell you the day’s weather. If you are short-sighted, and plan on weighing yourself first thing in the morning, before you’ve found your glasses or contacts, opt for a big, clear, high-contrast display.</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-app-and-subscriptions\">App and subscriptions</h3> \n<p>You’ll spend most of your time looking at your health data through its companion scales app, and it’s vital you get a good one. This includes a clear, clean layout with powerful tools to visualize your progress and analyze your data to look for places you can improve. Given that you often don’t need to buy anything before trying the app, it’s worth testing one or two to see if you vibe with it. It’s also important you check app compatibility before making your purchase. Some health apps will only work with iOS or Android — not both. Apple Watch connectivity can also be a bonus for tracking workouts and health metrics seamlessly. Several companies also offer premium subscriptions, unlocking other features – including insights and coaching – to go along with your hardware.</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-data-portability\">Data portability</h3> \n<p>Using the same scale or app platform for years at a time means you’ll build up a massive trove of personal data. And it is (or should be), your right to take that data to another provider if you choose to move platforms in the future. Data portability is, however, a minefield, with different platforms offering wildly different options, making it easy (or hard) to go elsewhere.</p> \n<p>All of the devices in this round-up will allow you to export your data to a .CSV file, which you can then do with as you wish. Importing this information is trickier, with Withings and Garmin allowing it, and Omron, Xiaomi, Eufy and Fitbit not making it that easy. (Apps that engage with Apple Health, meanwhile, can output all of your health data in a .XML file.)</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-power\">Power</h3> \n<p>It’s not a huge issue but one worth bearing in mind that each scale will either run disposable batteries (most commonly 4xAAA) or with its own, built-in battery pack. Either choice adds an environmental and financial cost to your scale’s life — either with regular purchases of fresh cells or the potential for the whole unit to become waste when the battery pack fails.</p> \n<h2 id=\"jump-link-how-we-tested-and-which-smart-scales-we-tested\">How we tested and which smart scales we tested</h2> \n<p>For this guide, I tested six scales from major manufacturers:</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-mi-xiaomi-body-composition-scale-2\">Mi (Xiaomi) Body Composition Scale 2</h3> \n<p>Our cheapest model, Xiaomi / Mi’s Body Composition Scale 2 is as bare-bones as you can get, and it shows. It often takes a long while to lock on to get your body weight, and when it does you’ll have to delve into the Zepp Life-branded scales app in order to look at your extra data. But you can’t fault it for the basics, offering limited (but accurate) weight measurements and body composition for less than the price of a McDonald’s for four.</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-fitbit-aira-air\"><a data-i13n=\"elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:;cpos:12;pos:1\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;itemId=amazon_B07VV6GKDS&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=b2af2a56-de99-4a43-8bd9-d5e576825e83&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;linkText=Fitbit+Aira+Air&amp;custData=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&amp;signature=AQAAAdDj-ypNk63duXjFYMZLF1GZcRdUXDvoLBQxEMFoUkT_&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FFitbit-FB203BK-Bluetooth-Digital-Weight%2Fdp%2FB07VV6GKDS\" class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" data-original-link=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9GaXRiaXQtRkIyMDNCSy1CbHVldG9vdGgtRGlnaXRhbC1XZWlnaHQvZHAvQjA3VlY2R0tEUz90YWc9Z2RndDBjLXAtby1jci0yMCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiYjJhZjJhNTYtZGU5OS00YTQzLThiZDktZDVlNTc2ODI1ZTgzIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAdedVAmboPWBTWdpUHTI7X3sMt__hDB1_bW8Ef-Yq4yH&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FFitbit-FB203BK-Bluetooth-Digital-Weight%2Fdp%2FB07VV6GKDS\">Fitbit Aira Air</a></h3> \n<p>Fitbit, now part of Google, is the household name for fitness trackers and smartwatches in the US, right? If not, then it must be at least halfway synonymous with it. The Aria Air is the company’s stripped-to-the-bare bones scale, offering your weight and a few other health metrics, but you can trust that Fitbit got the basics right. Not to mention that most of the reason for buying a Fitbit product is to leverage its fitness app anyway.</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-anker-eufy-smart-scale-p2-pro\"><a data-i13n=\"elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:;cpos:13;pos:1\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;itemId=amazon_B09NHR4NX7&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=b2af2a56-de99-4a43-8bd9-d5e576825e83&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;linkText=Anker+Eufy+Smart+Scale+P2+Pro&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5hbWF6b24uY29tL2V1ZnktQmF0aHJvb20tQmx1ZXRvb3RoLU1lYXN1cmVtZW50cy1JbmNsdWRpbmcvZHAvQjA5TkhSNE5YNy8_dGFnPWdkZ3QwYy0yMCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiYjJhZjJhNTYtZGU5OS00YTQzLThiZDktZDVlNTc2ODI1ZTgzIiwib3JpZ2luYWxVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5hbWF6b24uY29tL2V1ZnktQmF0aHJvb20tQmx1ZXRvb3RoLU1lYXN1cmVtZW50cy1JbmNsdWRpbmcvZHAvQjA5TkhSNE5YNy8iLCJkeW5hbWljQ2VudHJhbFRyYWNraW5nSWQiOnRydWUsInNpdGVJZCI6InVzLWVuZ2FkZ2V0IiwicGFnZUlkIjoiMXAtYXV0b2xpbmsiLCJmZWF0dXJlSWQiOiJ0ZXh0LWxpbmsifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAYVgINAbRwRm3giJnZ1bBorlgvMu7GYl3c23mPKttCkx&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Feufy-Bathroom-Bluetooth-Measurements-Including%2Fdp%2FB09NHR4NX7%2F\" class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" data-original-link=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9ldWZ5LUJhdGhyb29tLUJsdWV0b290aC1NZWFzdXJlbWVudHMtSW5jbHVkaW5nL2RwL0IwOU5IUjROWDcvP3RhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLWNyLTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJiMmFmMmE1Ni1kZTk5LTRhNDMtOGJkOS1kNWU1NzY4MjVlODMifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAQkVA5ofcfXgBHkGUcOOXsKMlPTtBM0pu-dOKiWpfQM9&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Feufy-Bathroom-Bluetooth-Measurements-Including%2Fdp%2FB09NHR4NX7%2F\">Anker Eufy Smart Scale P2 Pro</a></h3> \n<p>Eufy’s Smart Scale P2 Pro has plenty of things to commend it – the price, the overall look and feel (it’s a snazzy piece of kit) and what it offers. It offers a whole host of in-depth functionality, including Body Fat, Muscle Mass, Water Weight, Body Fat Mass and Bone Mass measurements, as well as calculating things like your Heart Rate and Basal Metabolic Rate (the amount of calories you need to eat a day to not change weight at all) all from inside its app. In fact, buried beneath the friendly graphic, the scale offers a big pile of stats and data that should, I think, give you more than a little coaching on how to improve your overall health.</p> \n<p>It’s worth noting that Anker – Eufy’s parent company – was identified as having misled users, and the media, about the security of its products a few years back. Its Eufy-branded security cameras, which the company says does not broadcast video outside of your local network, was found to be allowing third parties to access streams online. Consequently, while we have praised the Eufy Smart Scale for its own features, we cannot recommend it without a big caveat.</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-omron-bcm-500-body-composition-and-scale-with-bluetooth\"><a data-i13n=\"elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:;cpos:14;pos:1\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;itemId=amazon_B07WHMBH8K&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=b2af2a56-de99-4a43-8bd9-d5e576825e83&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;linkText=Omron+BCM-500+Body+Composition+and+Scale+with+Bluetooth&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5hbWF6b24uY29tL09tcm9uLUNvbXBvc2l0aW9uLU1vbml0b3ItQmx1ZXRvb3RoLUNvbm5lY3Rpdml0eS9kcC9CMDdXSE1CSDhLP3RhZz1nZGd0MGMtMjAiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6ImIyYWYyYTU2LWRlOTktNGE0My04YmQ5LWQ1ZTU3NjgyNWU4MyIsIm9yaWdpbmFsVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9PbXJvbi1Db21wb3NpdGlvbi1Nb25pdG9yLUJsdWV0b290aC1Db25uZWN0aXZpdHkvZHAvQjA3V0hNQkg4SyIsImR5bmFtaWNDZW50cmFsVHJhY2tpbmdJZCI6dHJ1ZSwic2l0ZUlkIjoidXMtZW5nYWRnZXQiLCJwYWdlSWQiOiIxcC1hdXRvbGluayIsImZlYXR1cmVJZCI6InRleHQtbGluayJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAWE-PF1FIn0SfsfHN5zib4pWHzpKvbnqRagnX09i-stV&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FOmron-Composition-Monitor-Bluetooth-Connectivity%2Fdp%2FB07WHMBH8K\" class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" data-original-link=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9PbXJvbi1Db21wb3NpdGlvbi1Nb25pdG9yLUJsdWV0b290aC1Db25uZWN0aXZpdHkvZHAvQjA3V0hNQkg4Sz90YWc9Z2RndDBjLXAtby1jci0yMCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiYjJhZjJhNTYtZGU5OS00YTQzLThiZDktZDVlNTc2ODI1ZTgzIn0&amp;signature=AQAAASi75Tjd0SgYfb-B9rkmhg6WTzW1HyxGlJthfPDFT3f3&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FOmron-Composition-Monitor-Bluetooth-Connectivity%2Fdp%2FB07WHMBH8K\">Omron BCM-500 Body Composition and Scale with Bluetooth</a></h3> \n<p>Given its role in making actual medical devices, you know what you’re getting with an Omron product.

A smart scale, on the other hand, does much more. Not only does it give you your weight measurements, but it can also track things like your body fat percentage, muscle mass, and even your BMI. Some smart scales even monitor more advanced metrics like bone density, depending on the model.</p> \n<p>What’s even better is that smart scales sync with scales apps on your phone using Wi-Fi or Bluetooth, so you can see all your health data in one place. This lets you monitor trends over time, like if your muscle mass is increasing or your body fat percentage decreasing.</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-how-do-smart-scales-work-with-more-than-one-person-using-it\">How do smart scales work with more than one person using it?</h3> \n<p>When more than one person in a household uses the smart scale, it usually recognizes each person by their weight range and other body measurements (like body fat percentage). Most smart scales allow you to set up individual profiles in the companion app, and once your profile is linked, the scale can automatically figure out who’s standing on it.</p> \n<p>Let’s say you and a family member have fairly different weights — the scale will easily know who’s who based on that. But if you and someone else have similar weights, it might ask you to confirm the profile on your phone after the weigh-in. Some scales even let you assign a profile manually in the scales app if it’s not sure.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/home/smart-home/best-smart-scale-160033523.html?src=rss",

    "title": "Instagram chief: AI is so ubiquitous 'it will be more practical to fingerprint real media than fake media'",
    "body": "<p>It&#39;s no secret that AI-generated content <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/techs-biggest-winners-of-2025-180000177.html\" data-i13n=\"cpos:1;pos:1\">took over</a> our social media feeds in 2025. Now, Instagram&#39;s top exec Adam Mosseri has made it clear that he expects AI content to overtake non-AI imagery and the significant implications that shift has for its creators and photographers.</p><p>Mosseri shared the thoughts in <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.threads.com/@mosseri/post/DS76UiklIDf/media\" data-i13n=\"cpos:2;pos:1\">a lengthy post</a> about the broader trends he expects to shape Instagram in 2026. And he offered a notably candid assessment on how AI is upending the platform. &quot;Everything that made creators matter—the ability to be real, to connect, to have a voice that couldn’t be faked—is now suddenly accessible to anyone with the right tools,&quot; he wrote. &quot;The feeds are starting to fill up with synthetic everything.&quot;</p><p>But Mosseri doesn&#39;t seem particularly concerned by this shift. He says that there is &quot;a lot of amazing AI content&quot; and that the platform may need to rethink its approach to labeling such imagery by &quot;fingerprinting real media, not just chasing fake.&quot;</p><p>From Mosseri (emphasis his):</p><blockquote><p>Social media platforms are going to come under increasing pressure to identify and label AI-generated content as such. All the major platforms will do good work identifying AI content, but they will get worse at it over time as AI gets better at imitating reality. There is already a growing number of people who believe, as I do, that<strong> it will be more practical to fingerprint real media than fake media</strong>. Camera manufacturers could cryptographically sign images at capture, creating a chain of custody.</p></blockquote><p>On some level, it&#39;s easy to understand how this seems like a more practical approach for Meta. As we&#39;ve previously reported, technologies that are meant to identify AI content, like watermarks, have proved unreliable at best. They are <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/researchers-say-current-ai-watermarks-are-trivial-to-remove-204414059.html\" data-i13n=\"cpos:3;pos:1\">easy to remove</a> and even easier to ignore altogether. Meta&#39;s own labels are <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/social-media/meta-hides-warning-labels-for-ai-edited-images-143004313.html\" data-i13n=\"cpos:4;pos:1\">far from clear</a> and the company, which has spent tens of billions of dollars on AI this year alone, has admitted it <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/social-media/the-oversight-board-calls-metas-uneven-ai-moderation-incoherent-and-unjustifiable-100056893.html\" data-i13n=\"cpos:5;pos:1\">can&#39;t reliably detect</a> AI-generated or manipulated content on its platform.</p><p>That Mosseri is so readily admitting defeat on this issue, though, is telling. AI slop has won. And when it comes to helping Instagram&#39;s 3 billion users understand what <em>is</em> real, that should largely be someone else&#39;s problem, not Meta&#39;s. Camera makers — presumably phone makers and actual camera manufacturers — should come up with their own system that sure sounds a lot like watermarking to &quot;to verify authenticity at capture.&quot; Mosseri offers few details about how this would work or be implemented at the scale required to make it feasible.</p><p>Mosseri also doesn&#39;t really address the fact that this is likely to alienate the many photographers and other Instagram creators who have already grown frustrated with the app. The exec regularly fields complaints from the group who want to know why Instagram&#39;s algorithm doesn&#39;t consistently surface their posts to their on followers.</p><p>But Mosseri suggests those complaints stem from an outdated vision of what Instagram even is. The feed of &quot;polished&quot; square images, he says, &quot;is dead.&quot; Camera companies, in his estimation, are &quot;are betting on the wrong aesthetic&quot; by trying to &quot;make everyone look like a professional photographer from the past.&quot; Instead, he says that more &quot;raw&quot; and &quot;unflattering&quot; images will be how creators can prove they are real, and not AI. In a world where Instagram has more AI content than not, creators should prioritize images and videos that intentionally make them look bad.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/social-media/instagram-chief-ai-is-so-ubiquitous-it-will-be-more-practical-to-fingerprint-real-media-than-fake-media-202620080.html?src=rss",

That&#39;s because the traditional end-of-press-day slot isn&#39;t just Sony, but rather Sony Honda Mobility — the joint venture responsible for the Afeela 1 electric car that has been showcased at CES for the better part of a decade.

But so many more important details were confirmed in the past couple of years, including the price, which starts at a staggering $89,900. However, the earlier impressions were less than impressive, and as of CES 2025, that thought remains the same.

Its CES booth will showcase &quot;several Afeela 1 pre-production vehicles in multiple color variations, alongside a new Afeela concept model,&quot; Sony Honda Mobility <a data-i13n=\"cpos:4;pos:1\" href=\"https://www.shm-afeela.com/en/news/2025-11-20/\">said in a press release</a>.</p>\n<p>We&#39;re hoping to hear about what&#39;s new and improved at CES 2026, and we&#39;re also excited to see its newest concept model.

LG, for example, has said it will <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/home/home-theater/lg-will-debut-its-first-micro-rgb-television-at-ces-010037923.html\" data-i13n=\"cpos:14;pos:1\">debut its first Micro RGB television at CES</a>. While details are scarce, the company’s press release for the LG Micro RGB evo did confirm it has received certifications by Intertek for 100 percent color gamut coverage in DCI-P3 an Adobe RGB, and that it has more than a thousand dimming zones for brightness control. </p><p>Elsewhere in the TV space, LG is throwing its hat into the “art TV” ring that Samsung pioneered with its Frame TVs: The <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/home/home-theater/lg-to-unveil-a-canvas-style-tv-at-ces-2026-010024691.html\" data-i13n=\"cpos:15;pos:1\">LG Gallery TV</a> will debut in 55- and 65-inch screen sizes, and it will of course show off various artwork when it’s not otherwise in use.

Next year, Samsung is expanding the range with 55-, 65-, 75-, 85-, 100- and 115-inch models that use the next evolution of the company’s Micro RGB technology. </p><p>Samsung is also countering LG’s 5K monitors with a <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/computing/accessories/samsungs-latest-odyssey-gaming-monitor-has-a-32-inch-6k-screen-with-glasses-free-3d-130051748.html\" data-i13n=\"cpos:22;pos:1\">6K model</a> that aims to deliver glasses-free 3D (another long-time CES staple).

    "body": "<p>Chances are that if a VPN is marketed to everyday users, it more or less runs itself. As long as you go with one of the <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/best-vpn-130004396.html\" data-i13n=\"cpos:1;pos:1\">best VPNs</a> instead of setting up your own manual connection, the interface is likely built so you have to engage with it as little as possible. Generally, if you find yourself constantly thinking about your VPN while using it — as happened to me with <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/norton-vpn-review-a-vpn-that-fails-to-meet-nortons-standards-170037086.html\" data-i13n=\"cpos:2;pos:1\">Norton VPN</a> — that&#39;s a bad thing and you should change providers.</p><p>That said, it&#39;s still useful to get a high-level view of how to use a VPN, especially if you&#39;ve never used one before. In this article, I&#39;ll walk you through how to download, install and configure a VPN on any platform and how to choose servers for specific situations. I&#39;ll also discuss specific steps for desktop and laptop computers, phones, tablets, smart TVs, game consoles and routers.</p><h2 id=\"e5ae9320-9e97-41d7-9412-e57ddfe9f8d5\">How to download and install a VPN</h2><p>There are over 100 VPNs available on the internet and the two big mobile app stores, but most of them follow a similar approach to download and installation. Except for certain <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/best-free-vpn-120032818.html\" data-i13n=\"cpos:3;pos:1\">free VPNs</a>, you&#39;ll need to create an account on the VPN provider&#39;s website, install the VPN client, then use your account to log in. Here are the steps.</p><ol><li><p>In a web browser, navigate to a VPN provider&#39;s website. For suggestions on where to start, check out our list of the <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/deals/the-best-vpn-deals-up-to-88-percent-off-protonvpn-surfshark-expressvpn-nordvpn-and-more-120056445.html\" data-i13n=\"cpos:4;pos:1\">best VPN deals</a>. Click any link that mentions getting the VPN or claiming the deal — as a rule, they aren&#39;t hard to find.</p></li><li><p>Select a plan based on the length of time you need the VPN for, the features you want and the number of devices you&#39;d like to use the VPN on simultaneously. Add a payment method. You&#39;ll be prompted to create the username and password for a new account.</p></li><li><p><strong>On desktop</strong>, you can start with the Mac or Windows app store, though some VPNs require a download directly from their respective website. That’s generally the way to get the most feature-rich version of the VPN, but just make sure you’re downloading from the provider’s website to ensure you don’t get a malicious copycat. <strong>On mobile</strong>, the app store is your only choice, but don&#39;t forget to check the reviews and make sure you&#39;re getting the service you paid for — unfortunately, rival (and sometimes less scrupulous) VPN brands can use paid placements to appear higher on search results, even for a rival product. </p></li><li><p>Follow the pre-programmed installation flow. Again, don&#39;t let a VPN make any changes to your system if you haven&#39;t thoroughly vetted the provider (or gone with one of our recommendations). If it&#39;s safe, allow the VPN all the setup permissions it needs.</p></li><li><p>Finally, open the VPN client and sign in with the credentials you created in step two. You&#39;re now ready to start using your new VPN.</p></li></ol><figure><img src=\"https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/Downloading_Surfshark_on_Mac.png\" data-crop-orig-src=\"https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/Downloading_Surfshark_on_Mac.png\" style=\"height:869px;width:1829px;\" alt=\"Surfshark in Mac downloads folder\" data-uuid=\"56f3ed7f-7483-4fc3-aed9-c2e389da2de0\"><figcaption>Surfshark in Mac downloads folder</figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Sam Chapman for Engadget</div></figure><p>With so many VPNs on the market, this process won&#39;t always be the same. Sometimes you&#39;ll have to make the account before paying, and some mobile VPNs let you handle the whole process in-app. What&#39;s always true, though, is that a good VPN will make the signup flow as easy as possible. If you have trouble before you even log in, that&#39;s a red flag.</p><h3 id=\"eab57cd3-f062-45cc-b880-91db0fe05fa4\">How to configure a VPN app</h3><p>Most VPNs are ready to go out of the box. However, even if you don&#39;t think you&#39;re a power user, it&#39;s a good idea to go through the settings and make sure they match what you need. Here are a few steps I recommend taking.</p><ol><li><p>Activate the kill switch. This feature monitors your connection to the VPN server. If it ever drops — either from problems in the server, your client or somewhere in between — the kill switch instantly cuts off your internet until your VPN connection is restored. This saves you from accidentally broadcasting anything sensitive while also ensuring you only connect to legitimate VPN servers (avoiding the <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.tunnelvisionbug.com/\" data-i13n=\"cpos:5;pos:1\">Tunnelvision bug</a>).</p></li><li><p>Set up favorites and profiles. VPNs usually let you select servers you&#39;ll use regularly, websites you&#39;ll often connect to through the VPN and other preferences that will appear immediately when you open the app. Some go further, like <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/proton-vpn-review-2025-a-nonprofit-service-with-premium-performance-153046073.html\" data-i13n=\"cpos:6;pos:1\">Proton VPN</a>, which lets you create user profiles that bundle several preferences together.</p></li><li><p>Decide if you want the VPN to automatically launch and connect when you start up your computer.</p></li><li><p>Check on split tunneling. There may be cases where you want a certain app or site to work outside the VPN, or where you want everything to go unencrypted except one site or app. You can set up a split tunnel when you need it, but if there&#39;s one you know you&#39;ll use regularly, it helps to build it early.</p></li><li><p>Activate or deactivate any content blockers the VPN comes with, including ad blockers, malware detectors and parental controls, as you see fit.</p></li><li><p>Decide whether you want the VPN to send you notifications, and how.</p></li><li><p>Select a VPN protocol. It&#39;s almost always best to let the VPN choose for itself, but it&#39;s helpful to at least know where the protocol-switching option is. Occasionally, if one protocol isn&#39;t working, you can troubleshoot by selecting another.</p></li></ol><p>You can do all this by digging into your VPN&#39;s preferences control panel. A gear seems to be the universal icon for that, but Mac users may also find it by picking &quot;preferences&quot; or &quot;settings&quot; from the menu bar. When you find the preferences menu, go through each tab in turn and make sure everything is the way you like it.</p><h3 id=\"511e0968-4f3a-4690-aad7-bfb431046f9b\">How to choose a VPN server</h3><p>Picking a server location is the final box to check before connecting. You nearly always have the option of letting the VPN pick the best server. Most apps tend to determine the best server with a latency test, so it will almost always be a node very close to your physical location.</p><p>If you just want anonymity online, that&#39;s fine — it doesn&#39;t matter which IP address you use as long as it&#39;s not your real one. But several VPN use cases do require a specific server location. For those, follow one simple rule: Pick a server in the place you want your signal to come from.</p><figure><img src=\"https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/Surfshark_for_How_to_Use.png\" data-crop-orig-src=\"https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/Surfshark_for_How_to_Use.png\" style=\"height:1188px;width:1588px;\" alt=\"Choosing locations on Surfshark\" data-uuid=\"ad20ffff-2e09-42e7-93d3-bcae41563393\"><figcaption>Choosing locations on Surfshark</figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Sam Chapman for Engadget</div></figure><p>For example, let&#39;s say you want to watch <em>The Office, </em>but you&#39;re only subscribed to Netflix and not Peacock. Luckily, Netflix is licensed to show <em>The Office </em>in the U.K. If you connect to a British server location before opening Netflix, you&#39;ll be able to access the show without paying for an extra subscription. (Of course, make sure VPNs aren’t expressly banned by the streaming service’s terms of service before accessing it while using one.)</p><p>Other than streaming, the most common reason you&#39;ll need a specific VPN server is to get around firewalls that block websites. Whether it&#39;s your school doing the censorship, your workplace or your entire state, the solution is the same: Pick a VPN server outside the restricted region. Censorship systems filter by location — they can&#39;t block where they don&#39;t have jurisdiction. Get a new virtual location and you should be free and clear. (Always be cognizant of the laws on VPN usage in your location before activating them.)</p><h3 id=\"5ea22123-706d-4712-80ee-c4c41d00eaa2\">When to use a VPN (and when not to)</h3><p>It&#39;s good to get into the habit of connecting to your VPN whenever you get online. You can never be sure what information your ISP is gathering on you. If you&#39;re using unprotected Wi-Fi, or a public network with a clearly visible password, anybody might be listening in. Even if you don&#39;t need a particular location, always be using your VPN.</p><p>The only reason you might want to be online without a VPN is that certain websites, especially online banks, get suspicious if they note repeated logins to the same account from too many different IP addresses. For those cases, you can either set up a split tunnel to exclude the website from encryption, or temporarily turn your VPN off altogether.</p><h2 id=\"1254cc3e-6927-44fa-9785-06bcc25cbd13\">Instructions for specific devices</h2><p>Although most VPNs try to keep their apps similar on every platform, the strictures of differing hardware and software lead them to install and operate differently. In case you still have questions after reading the general guide above, this section goes into detail on every platform where you might use a VPN.</p><h3 id=\"69d7feab-ae9f-4c04-b668-4b23ed247ede\">How to use a VPN on desktop</h3><p>After subscribing to a VPN on <strong>Windows</strong>, you should be directed to download an EXE file — if this doesn&#39;t happen, log into your account on the website and find the downloads center. Find the folder where the EXE is saved, double-click it and follow the onscreen instructions.</p><p>On <strong>Mac</strong>, the process is more or less the same, except you&#39;ll usually get a PKG file instead of an EXE. Go to your downloads folder (either in Finder or through your web browser) and double-click the PKG file. Grant the VPN whatever permissions it needs. (Again, this is why it’s important to only use a legitimate vendor, such as the ones we recommend.)</p><p>Once installed, you can open the VPN client at any time by double-clicking the icon again. Some VPNs open as separate windows, while others will add icons to your toolbar. This often varies by platform; if you&#39;re concerned that your VPN doesn&#39;t look like a screenshot you&#39;ve seen, check which operating system the image comes from.</p><h3 id=\"6a9b37a7-441d-49e7-994c-5701c621aa09\">How to use a VPN on mobile</h3><p>On <strong>Android </strong>and <strong>iOS</strong>, you&#39;ll download your VPN app through the Google Play Store or Apple App Store, respectively. Even if you get started through a mobile browser, it will probably redirect you to the app store for the actual download and installation.</p><p>Follow the usual step for downloading an app: search for its name in the app store, click &quot;Get&quot; or &quot;Install,&quot; then let your phone cook. As always, so long as it&#39;s a vetted VPN, grant it the permissions it needs. You may be able to download and install the VPN first, then create your account and submit payment through the app afterward.</p><p>One final note: several leading VPNs offer free trials for mobile users. If you see a button that says something like &quot;get free trial,&quot; you may be able to use the VPN for several days without paying. Just be warned that if the trial lapses, you might get automatically signed up for a plan that&#39;s longer than you&#39;d like.</p><h3 id=\"ba5edfbb-5471-45fc-9fc0-70bc182b1fad\">How to use a VPN browser extension</h3><p>VPNs offer browser extensions as lightweight versions of their main clients. While a desktop or mobile VPN reroutes everything that device sends to the internet, a browser extension only protects traffic through your web browser. You can use one as a primitive form of split tunneling, but they&#39;re mainly for basic convenience — most of what you do online goes through a browser, so it&#39;s nice to be able to protect your connection without opening a separate app.</p><figure><img src=\"https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/NordVPN_browser_extension.png\" data-crop-orig-src=\"https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/NordVPN_browser_extension.png\" style=\"height:1352px;width:2673px;\" alt=\"NordVPN browser extension on Chrome\" data-uuid=\"a448ba0a-eb2d-4c2f-8d5a-75d05e9b58ad\"><figcaption>NordVPN browser extension on Chrome</figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Sam Chapman for Engadget</div></figure><p>To use a VPN browser extension, just create your account as normal, then download the extension from your VPN&#39;s website. You can manage it from your browser&#39;s extensions center. That&#39;s a jigsaw piece at the top-right corner on most browsers, including Chrome, Edge and Firefox.</p><h3 id=\"281a98b7-ad86-42d8-960c-427b3d41fb36\">How to use a VPN on a smart TV</h3><p>You can use a VPN to change your location and stream international content directly to a smart TV. The catch is that not all smart TV brands support VPN apps. For those that don&#39;t, <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/how-to-add-vpn-to-your-tv-143736648.html\" data-i13n=\"cpos:7;pos:1\">you&#39;ll have to find a workaround</a>.</p><p>The good news is that a ton of the best smart TVs can natively host VPNs, including <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/how-to-use-a-vpn-on-chromecast-or-google-tv-140619467.html\" data-i13n=\"cpos:8;pos:1\">Google TV</a>, Android TV, <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/how-to-add-a-vpn-on-fire-tv-101822833.html\" data-i13n=\"cpos:9;pos:1\">Amazon Fire TV</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/how-to-use-a-vpn-on-apple-tv-113345245.html\" data-i13n=\"cpos:10;pos:1\">Apple TV</a> (though only tvOS 17 and above).

You can use a smart DNS feature like <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/vpn-review-expressvpn-2023-gaming-streaming-160052492.html\" data-i13n=\"cpos:12;pos:1\">ExpressVPN&#39;s MediaStreamer</a> to reroute smart TV traffic without full VPN encryption; the steps for this are different for every VPN, so check the provider&#39;s website. You can also install a VPN on your router (see below) so your smart TV automatically uses the router&#39;s location.</p><p>Finally, you can get a temporary fix by using your computer as a Wi-Fi hotspot while it has a VPN active. Follow the steps for your operating system.</p><p>On Windows:</p><ol><li><p>In your system settings, go to &quot;Network &amp; Internet&quot; and turn on the mobile hotspot.</p></li><li><p>Go to &quot;Network &amp; Sharing Center&quot; and click &quot;Change adapter settings.&quot;</p></li><li><p>Right-click the name of your VPN provider and go to &quot;Properties,&quot; then &quot;Sharing.&quot;</p></li><li><p>Check the boxes next to &quot;Allow other network users to connect through this computer&#39;s internet connection&quot; and &quot;Allow other network users to control or disable the shared internet connection.&quot;</p></li><li><p>Click the &quot;Home networking connection&quot; dropdown and select &quot;Microsoft Wi-Fi Direct Virtual Adapter.&quot;</p></li><li><p>Open your VPN client and connect to a server in your desired location.</p></li><li><p>On your smart TV, open the internet connections menu and select the name of your PC.

If you want to use a VPN while gaming — and I recommend that for safety if you&#39;re planning to play online — you can use two of the same methods that work for a smart TV: install a VPN on your router, or get your console online through a Mac or PC hotspot.</p><h3 id=\"348a0322-4456-4ddf-8252-083e29f2d15e\">How to install a VPN on a router</h3><p>When you install a router VPN, anything that gets online through your home network will be protected, including game consoles, TVs and smart devices that don&#39;t support VPNs natively. It&#39;s not a process for the faint of heart, though. You&#39;ll need to get a new router and potentially install VPN firmware on it yourself. If you want to go this route, the easiest option is to get an <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"link rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=4255ebf1-6185-403e-9be2-91ab47ad1ac3&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=52aa4501-7372-4990-ab5c-a027e398a215&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=ExpressVPN&amp;linkText=ExpressVPN+Aircove+router&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5leHByZXNzdnBuLmNvbS9haXJjb3ZlPyIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiNTJhYTQ1MDEtNzM3Mi00OTkwLWFiNWMtYTAyN2UzOThhMjE1Iiwib3JpZ2luYWxVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5leHByZXNzdnBuLmNvbS9haXJjb3ZlPyJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAQcQcoBXc2t-ZvPzzwUVEtcI1Gdh5Zyj_vAr0g6ymVzJ&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.expressvpn.com%2Faircove%3F\" data-i13n=\"elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:ExpressVPN;elmt:;cpos:13;pos:1\" data-original-link=\"https://www.expressvpn.com/aircove?\">ExpressVPN Aircove router</a> — not only does it come with all the settings done for you, but it can be managed through the same clean interface as ExpressVPN&#39;s other apps.</p><p>We don&#39;t have space here to go through the entire process, but here&#39;s a general overview. First, get a router with firmware that supports VPN configurations — most ISP default routers don&#39;t, so you&#39;ll have to go third-party.</p><p>Next, go to the downloads center of your VPN&#39;s website and look for the section with VPN configurations. A &quot;configuration&quot; is a complete set of the information needed to access a certain VPN server through a certain protocol — say, a Proton VPN server in Arizona through OpenVPN. Download a configuration file for the protocol and location you want all your home devices to connect through.</p><p>Finally, open your router control panel by entering your router&#39;s IP address into a web browser address bar, then log in with your router credentials (these should be marked on the router itself unless you&#39;ve changed them). Go to the VPN tab — which should be there if it&#39;s a router with VPN firmware — and upload the profile you downloaded from the VPN website. Use the same router control panel to activate and deactivate the router VPN connection.</p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/how-to-use-a-vpn-140000564.html?src=rss",

However, I’m still a big believer in compact cameras. They’re a noticeable step up from smartphones quality-wise, and a lot of people will take a compact traveling or to events when they’d never bother with the hassle of a DSLR or mirrorless camera.</p> \n<p>Compacts largely have type 1-inch sensors, but a few offer larger options, particularly Fujifilm’s XF-100V. Another popular model, Sony’s XV-1, is primarily aimed at content creators looking to step up. In any case, desirable qualities include image quality, a fast lens, relatively long zoom, flip-out display, good battery life, a high quality EVF, decent video and good pocketability.</p> \n<p>\n <core-commerce id=\"cd03eff4cbdc4130bf293bf0147c94d1\" data-type=\"product-list\" data-original-url=\"https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1811352-REG/fujifilm_16821822_x100vi_digital_camera_silver.html\"></core-commerce></p> \n<p>\n <core-commerce id=\"1e50f52ddf4d41d6aee53f485e29a24c\" data-type=\"product-list\" data-original-url=\"https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Camera-Content-Creators-Vloggers/dp/B0C62F451G\"></core-commerce></p> \n<h2 id=\"jump-link-what-to-consider-before-choosing-a-camera\">What to consider before choosing a camera</h2> \n<p>Though smartphones get better for video and photos every year, full cameras still have an edge in many ways. The larger sensors in mirrorless cameras let more light in, and you have a wide choice of lenses with far superior optics. Dedicated cameras are also faster for shooting things like sports or wildlife, offer superior video for content creators and create more professional results.</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-sensor-size\">Sensor size</h3> \n<p>There are a few key things to consider to get the most out of a camera. The first is sensor size: in general, the larger the sensor, the better (and usually more expensive) the camera.</p> \n<p>Full frame is the largest sensor size for mainstream cameras, and it’s available on models like the new Panasonic S9, the Nikon Z III and Canon EOS R5 II. At a size equivalent to 35mm film (36 x 24mm), it offers the best performance in terms of image quality, low-light capability and depth of field. But it’s also very expensive and finicky. While bokeh looks incredible at an aperture of f/1.4, the depth of field is so razor thin that your subject&#39;s eyebrow might be in focus but not their eye. This can also make shooting video difficult.</p> \n<p>The next size category is APS-C (around 23.5 x 15.6mm for most models and 22.2 x 14.8mm for Canon), offered on Fujifilm&#39;s X Series lineup, the Canon R10, the Sony ZV-E10 II and the Nikon Z50. It&#39;s cheaper than full frame, both for the camera body and lenses, but still brings most of the advantages like decent bokeh, high ISOs for low-light shooting and relatively high resolution. With a sensor size the same as movie cameras, it&#39;s ideal for shooting video, and it’s easier to hold focus than with full-frame cameras.</p> \n<p>Micro Four Thirds (17.3 x 13mm), a format shared by Panasonic and Olympus, is the next step down in sensor size. It offers less bokeh and light-gathering capability than APS-C and full frame, but allows for smaller and lighter cameras and lenses. For video, you can still get reasonably tight depth of field with good prime lenses, but focus is easier to control.</p> \n<p>The other common sensor size is Type 1 (1 inch), which is actually smaller than one inch at 12.7 x 9.5mm. That&#39;s used mostly by compact models like Sony’s ZV-1 vlogging camera. Finally, action cameras like the GoPro Hero 11 and DJI’s Osmo 3 have even smaller sensors (1/1.9 and 1/1.7 inches, respectively).</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-autofocus\">Autofocus</h3> \n<p>For photographers, another key factor is autofocus (AF) speed and accuracy. Most modern mirrorless cameras have hybrid phase-detect AF systems that allow for rapid focus and fast burst speeds. The majority also offer AI features like eye-detect AF for people and animals, which locks in on the subject’s eyes, face or body to keep them in focus. However, some models are faster and more reactive than others.</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-displays\">Displays</h3> \n<p>The electronic viewfinder (EVF) and rear display are also crucial. The best models have the sharpest and brightest EVFs that help you judge a shot before taking it. For things like street photography, it’s best to have as bright and sharp a rear display as possible, so it’s easy to see your subject and check focus in all manner of lighting conditions. You may also want a screen that flips out rather than just tilting, too.</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-lenses\">Lenses</h3> \n<p>DSLRs and mirrorless cameras let you change lenses, but you&#39;re stuck with what&#39;s built into a compact camera. While that&#39;s great for portability, a single lens means you&#39;re going to sacrifice <em>something</em> along the way. The Fujifilm X100V, for instance, has a fast but fixed 35mm-equivalent f/2.0 lens and no zoom. The Sony RX100 V has a 24-70mm zoom, but it&#39;s slower at the telephoto end (f/2.8) and less sharp than a fixed focal (prime) lens.</p> \n<p>When choosing a lens for a mirrorless camera, you’ll need to consider the focal or zoom length, along with the minimum aperture. Smaller numbers like f/1.4 for a prime lens or f/2.8 for a zoom are best, as they let you work in darker environments and maximize background blur to isolate your subject. However, those lenses are more complex and thus more expensive.</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-video-recording\">Video recording</h3> \n<p>When it comes to video, there are other factors to consider. Some cameras combine or skip over pixels (line skipping or pixel binning) for video recording, which is not ideal because it can reduce sharpness. Better cameras tend to read out the entire sensor and then “downsample” to improve video sharpness (camera manufacturers don’t often say if video is pixel binned, but will say if it’s downsampled). Another important factor is sensor speed, as slower sensors tend to have more rolling shutter that can create a “jello” effect that skews video.</p> \n<p>In addition, how’s the battery life? How do you like the handling and feel? How long can you shoot before the camera heats up or stops? Does it support 10-bit HDR video? Is there a microphone and/or a headphone jack? (If you record a lot of interviews, it&#39;s preferable to have both.) How&#39;s the video autofocus? All of these things play a part in your decision.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/cameras/best-cameras-151524327.html?src=rss",

In its worst-case-scenario model, the IDC predicts PC shipments could shrink by up to 8.9 percent in 2026 because of the high cost of memory.</p><p>&quot;Instead of expanding conventional DRAM and NAND used in smartphones, PCs and other consumer electronics, major memory makers have shifted production toward memory used in AI data centers, such as high-bandwidth (HBM) and high-capacity DDR5,&quot; IDC writes. That&#39;s continued to drive up the price of the RAM that is available for PC makers, which has naturally led to them to raise the price of their own products to stay above water. For example, modular PC maker Framework has already <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"link\" href=\"https://frame.work/blog/in-stock-on-framework-desktop-and-updates-on-the-industry-wide-silicon-crunch\" data-i13n=\"cpos:4;pos:1\">had to raise prices</a> on some of its laptops and parts, and says &quot;further cost and price increases are highly likely over the next months.&quot; The IDC says prices could rise by 6 to 8 percent in 2026 if its most pessimistic scenario comes true.</p><p>The timing of this RAM crunch is particularly ironic because selling <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/computing/amd-explains-its-ai-pc-strategy-123004804.html\" data-i13n=\"cpos:5;pos:1\">&quot;AI PCs&quot;</a> — computers with neural processing units that can run AI models locally — were supposed to be one of the things pulling the PC industry out of its post-pandemic slump. Instead, those computers&#39; larger RAM needs leave them more vulnerable to the effects of the AI industry itself. Computers aren&#39;t the only electronics impacted, either. The IDC says the average selling price of a smartphone could grow by 6 to 8 percent in its most pessimistic scenario, and smartphone shipments could shrink by as much as 5.2 percent.&nbsp;</p><p>Companies like Apple and Samsung, with cash to spare and long-term supply agreements, could weather these higher RAM prices and keep things consistent for a year or two, according to the IDC. For everyone else, though, the near-term is looking much more expensive, and by necessity, much less adventurous.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/computing/idc-warns-of-major-pc-market-downturn-due-to-memory-crunch-214510197.html?src=rss",

The Galaxy A17 5G starts at $199 and will be available on January 7.

The photography setup is also unchanged from last year&#39;s model, with a 50MP main camera, 5MP ultrawide, 2MP macro and 13MP selfie lenses. The base model has 4GB of RAM and 128GB of storage, but can be upgraded with up to 2TB of additional storage via microSD.

Like with the Galaxy A17 5G, the tablet can also be juiced up with additional microSD storage. Performance-wise, you&#39;ll top out at 15 hours of video playback on the battery, but fast-charging is also supported here.

Most iPad covers are cases that surround the back of your tablet and have a flap that covers the screen, so it provides protection for the body as well as its display. Plenty of iPad cases also have screen covers, but you don’t have to get one with that feature. Instead, you could just get a case that hugs the back of the tablet and nothing else. Those accessories will be marginally thinner and lighter than their cover-toting counterparts, and give your iPad a more svelte profile.</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-how-often-should-i-charge-my-ipad\">How often should I charge my iPad?</h3> \n<p>How often you charge your iPad will depend on how often you use it. Most iPads will last at least a regular work day with frequent usage, which is one of the reasons why many have opted to use their iPads as laptop replacements. But with heavy usage, like constant video streaming or gaming, will come more rapid battery drain. A good rule of thumb is to charge your iPad when you go to sleep each night, that way you’ll have a topped-up device waiting for you in the morning.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/computing/accessories/best-ipad-cases-to-protect-your-tablet-130033533.html?src=rss",

On December 17, the Senate <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/science/space/jared-isaacman-is-nasas-new-leader-220833691.html\" data-i13n=\"cpos:2;pos:1\">confirmed billionaire Jared Isaacman</a> as the agency&#39;s new administrator. He now holds the power to rehabilitate a battered engine of scientific research, or steer it towards even more disruption.&nbsp;</p><p>Considering the caliber of President Trump&#39;s other appointees, Isaacman is probably the best candidate for the job. Outside of being a successful entrepreneur, he has flown fighter jets and been to space twice as part of the <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/spacex-inspiration4-mission-full-crew-143428383.html\" data-i13n=\"cpos:3;pos:1\">Inspiration4</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/science/space/polaris-dawn-is-finally-headed-to-space-for-its-groundbreaking-civilian-mission-093346616.html\" data-i13n=\"cpos:4;pos:1\">Polaris Dawn</a> private missions. One of those flights saw him <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/science/space/the-polaris-dawn-crew-is-back-on-earth-after-a-historic-mission-142028997.html\" data-i13n=\"cpos:5;pos:1\">complete the first commercial space walk</a>, and travel farther from Earth than any human since the end of the Apollo program.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&quot;Perfect is the enemy of the good. Isaacman checks a lot of boxes,&quot; says Keith Cowing, a former NASA employee and the founder of <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"link\" href=\"https://nasawatch.com/\" data-i13n=\"cpos:6;pos:1\">NASA Watch, a blog dedicated to the agency.</a> &quot;He&#39;s passed every requirement to fly in a spacecraft that American astronauts at NASA are required to pass. He also went out of his way to have a diverse crew, and shove as much science as he could in those missions.&quot;&nbsp;</p><p>And yet if you&#39;re a NASA employee or just someone who cares about the agency&#39;s work, there are still plenty of reasons to be concerned for its future. When Trump first nominated Isaacman in the spring, the billionaire wrote a 62-page document detailing his vision for NASA. In November, <em>Politico</em> <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2025/11/03/jared-isaacman-confidential-manifesto-nasa-00633858\" data-i13n=\"cpos:7;pos:1\">obtained a copy of that plan</a>, titled Project Athena.</p><p>To some insiders, Project Athena painted a picture of someone who, at least at the time when it was written, fundamentally misunderstood how NASA works and how scientific discovery is funded in the US and elsewhere. It also suggests Isaacman may be more open to Trump&#39;s NASA agenda than would appear at first glance.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>When asked about the plan by <em>Politico</em>, one former NASA official characterized it as &quot;bizarre and careless.&quot; Another called it “presumptuous,&quot; given many of the proposed changes to the agency&#39;s structure would require Congressional approval. In one section, Isaacman recommended taking “NASA out of the taxpayer funded climate science business and [leaving] it for academia to determine.” In another section, he promised to evaluate the “relevance and ongoing necessity” of every agency center, particularly NASA&#39;s iconic Jet Propulsion Laboratory, saying the facility and others must increase the “output and time to science KPI.”&nbsp;</p><p>A lot has changed since Isaacman first wrote that document. It came before the workforce cuts, before the <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2025/11/04/science/nasa-goddard-building-closures-government-shutdown\" data-i13n=\"cpos:8;pos:1\">future of Goddard Space Flight Center</a> became uncertain and before Trump surprised everyone by renominating Isaacman. But <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2025/12/03/science/nasa-jared-isaacman-confirmation-hearing\" data-i13n=\"cpos:9;pos:1\">during his Senate testimony</a> earlier this month, the billionaire said “I do stand behind everything in the document, even though it was written seven months ago. I think it was all directionally correct.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>He did appear to distance himself from some viewpoints expressed in or inferred by Project Athena, however. Isaacman stated that “anything suggesting that I am anti-science or want to outsource that responsibility is simply untrue.” He also came out against the administration&#39;s plan to cut NASA&#39;s science budget nearly in half, claiming the proposals would <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"link\" href=\"https://spacenews.com/isaacman-calls-potential-nasa-science-cuts-not-optimal/\" data-i13n=\"cpos:10;pos:1\">not lead to &quot;an optimal outcome.&quot;</a></p><p>One thing is clear, Isaacman is not your typical bureaucrat. &quot;One of the pitfalls of some prior NASA administrators has been that they&#39;ve shown too much reverence for the internal processes and bureaucratic structure of the agency to the detriment of decision-making and performance,&quot; <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.planetary.org/profiles/casey-dreier\" data-i13n=\"cpos:11;pos:1\">said Casey Drier</a>, chief of space policy at <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.planetary.org/\" data-i13n=\"cpos:12;pos:1\">The Planetary Society</a>, a nonprofit that advocates for the exploration and study of space. &quot;Isaacman has positioned himself as the opposite of that. Clearly, that&#39;s something that could lead to a lot of political and congressional challenges if taken too far.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Even if Isaacman doesn&#39;t follow through on any of the proposals made in Project Athena, there&#39;s only so much a NASA administrator — even one sympathetic to civil servants working under them — can do.&nbsp;</p><p>&quot;Once a budget request goes out publicly, everyone in the administration has to defend it. Anything he does will have to be internal and private,&quot; Drier explains. &quot;He never explicitly criticized the administration during his hearing. He&#39;s also coming relatively late in the budget process.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>A lot of NASA&#39;s future will depend on the White House Office of Management and Budget (OMB), which is responsible for implementing the president&#39;s agenda across the executive branch. As a direct result of <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"link\" href=\"https://bipartisanpolicy.org/explainer/what-does-the-updated-omb-circular-a-11-mean-for-how-congress-appropriates-funding/\" data-i13n=\"cpos:13;pos:1\">guidance</a> the OMB issued over the summer, NASA <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.planetary.org/charts/fy-2025-nasas-rate-of-new-grants\" data-i13n=\"cpos:14;pos:1\">awarded 25 percent fewer new grants</a> in 2025 than it did on average between 2020 and 2024.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&quot;The OMB has added layers of requirements that scientists now have to go through to spend the money they&#39;ve already been allocated. The administration has worked against its own stated goals of efficiency,&quot; Drier said. &quot;Isaacman can&#39;t solve that himself. He can&#39;t tell the OMB what to do. That&#39;s going to be a serious challenge.&quot;&nbsp;</p><p>Looming over everything is the fact NASA still does not have a full-year budget for 2026. Congress has until January 30 to fund NASA and the rest of the federal government before the short-term funding bill it passed on November 12 runs out. &quot;On paper, the official policy of the administration is still to terminate a third of NASA&#39;s scientific capability,&quot; Drier points out.</p><p>There are reasons to be cautiously optimistic. Publicly, both the House and Senate have come out against Trump&#39;s funding cuts. And some science missions that were slated to be cancelled, such as <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/osiris-rex-apex-apophis-asteroid-visit-154021788.html\" data-i13n=\"cpos:15;pos:1\">OSIRIS-APEX</a>, have been approved for another full year of operations.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>What NASA needs now is someone who will, as Drier puts it, &quot;vigorously advocate&quot; for the agency in whatever way they can. It remains to be seen if that&#39;s Jared Isaacman.</p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/science/space/nasa-finally-has-a-leader-but-its-future-is-no-more-certain-201109072.html?src=rss",

Instead, think about the types of devices (phones included) that you could see yourself using in the near future. If you’re sure you’ll use iPhones for a long time, an Apple MagSafe-compatible magnetic wireless charger will be faster and more convenient. If you use Android phones or think you might switch sides, however, you’ll want a more universal design. If you have other accessories like wireless earbuds or a smartwatch that supports wireless charging, maybe you’d be better off with a <a data-i13n=\"cpos:7;pos:1\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/computing/accessories/best-multi-device-wireless-charging-pads-120557582.html\">3-in-1 wireless charger</a> or full wireless charging station.</p> <span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span>\n<h2 id=\"jump-link-where-and-how-will-you-use-your-charger\">Where and how will you use your charger?</h2> \n<figure>\n <img src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-02/c9a24a20-b7a0-11ed-b3cd-16d5d607f8d1\" data-uuid=\"5b99f136-c81a-38f1-8f9a-1e8f41fca499\">\n <figcaption></figcaption>\n</figure> \n<p>Odds are that you have a specific use case in mind for your charger. You may want it by your bedside on your nightstand for a quick charge in the morning, or on your desk for at-a-glance notifications. You might even keep it in your bag for convenient travel charging instead of bulky portable chargers or power banks. Think about where you want to use this accessory and what you want to do with the device(s) it charges while it’s powering up. For example, a wireless charging pad might be better for bedside use if you just want to be able to drop your phone down at the end of a long day and know it’ll be powered up in the morning. However, a stand will be better if you have an iPhone and want to make use of the Standby feature during the nighttime hours.</p> \n<p>For a desk wireless charger, a stand lets you more easily glance at phone notifications throughout the day. For traveling, undoubtedly, a puck-style charging pad is best since it will take up much less space in your bag than a stand would. Many power banks also include wireless charging pads built in, so one of those might make even more sense for those who are always on the go. Some foldable chargers are also designed for travel, collapsing flat to take up less space.</p> \n<h2 id=\"jump-link-wireless-charging-performance\">Wireless charging performance</h2> \n<p>Although wireless charging is usually slower than its wired equivalent, speed and wattage are still important considerations. A fast charger can supply enough power for a long night out in the time it takes to change outfits. Look for options that promise faster charging and support standards like Qi2 certified charging for the best balance of efficiency and compatibility.</p> \n<p>In general, a 15W charger is more than quick enough for most situations, and you’ll need a MagSafe-compatible charger to extract that level of performance from an iPhone. With that said, even the slower 7.5W and 10W chargers are fast enough for an overnight power-up. If anything, you’ll want to worry more about support for cases. While many models can deliver power through a reasonably thick case (typically 3mm to 5mm), you’ll occasionally run into examples that only work with naked phones.</p> \n<p>There are some proprietary chargers that smash the 15W barrier if you have the right phone.

Some wireless chargers don’t include power adapters, and others may even ask you to reuse your phone’s USB-C charging cable. What may seem to be a bargain may prove expensive if you have to buy extras just to use it properly. As mentioned above, you’ll want to make sure all of the components needed to use the wireless charger can provide the level of power you need — you’re only as strong (or in this case, fast) as your weakest link.</p> \n<p>Fit and finish is also worth considering. You’re likely going to use your wireless charger every day, so even small differences in build quality could make the difference between joy and frustration. If your charger doesn’t use MagSafe-compatible tech, textured surfaces like fabric or rubberized plastic are more likely to keep your phone in place. The base should be grippy or weighty enough that the charger won’t slide around. Also double check that the wireless charger you’re considering can support phones outfitted with cases — the specifications are usually listed in the charger’s description or specs.</p> \n<p>You’ll also want to think about the minor conveniences. Status lights are useful for indicating correct phone placement, but an overly bright light can be distracting. Ideally, the light dims or shuts off after a certain period of time. And while we caution against lips and trays that limit compatibility, you may still want some barriers to prevent your device falling off its perch on the charging station.</p> \n<h2 id=\"jump-link-wireless-chargers-faqs\">Wireless chargers FAQs</h2> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-do-wireless-chargers-work-if-you-have-a-phone-case\">Do wireless chargers work if you have a phone case?</h3> \n<p>Many wireless chargers do work if you leave the case on your phone. Generally, a case up to 3mm thick should be compatible with most wireless chargers. However, you should check the manufacturer’s guide to ensure a case is supported.</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-how-do-i-know-if-my-phone-supports-wireless-charging\">How do I know if my phone supports wireless charging?</h3> \n<p>Checking the phone’s specification should tell you if your phone is compatible with wireless charging. You might see words like “Qi wireless charging” or “wireless charging compatible.”</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-do-cords-charge-your-phone-faster\">Do cords charge your phone faster?</h3> \n<p>Most often, wired charging will be faster than wireless charging. However, wired charging also depends on what the charging cable’s speed is and how much power it’s designed to carry. A quick-charging cable that can transmit up to 120W of power is going to be faster than a wireless charger.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/computing/accessories/best-wireless-charger-140036359.html?src=rss",

And with some incredible new releases this year, we were really eatin’ good. Here are some of the Engadget team’s favorite things we listened to in 2025.</p><h2 id=\"aff7f80e-bda8-4cf9-8dfb-79488507995c\">Spiritbox - <em>Tsunami Sea</em></h2><p>I became aware of Spiritbox in late 2024 shortly before the band dropped its latest album, <em>Tsunami Sea. </em>At the time, I was in a deep Sleep Token phase, and I don’t remember how I stumbled upon Spiritbox, but I’m sure glad I did. Not knowing anything about the band, I initially thought it had two singers: one for clean vocals and another for the harsh, guttural screams.&nbsp;</p><p>Well, I was wrong. Vocalist Courtney LaPlante handles it all, and she is a force of nature. After learning of a new band, I do what any self-respecting music nerd does: I looked up live videos of them on YouTube. The way LaPlante seamlessly transitions from airy, ambient singing to some of the best growls you’ll hear in metal music is effortless. And after seeing Spiritbox live in person earlier in December, I can attest to her ability to consistently nail both vocal styles for the entirety of an hour-long set.&nbsp;</p><p>My infatuation with Spiritbox isn’t just with the vocalist though. Guitarist Mike Stringer, LaPlante’s husband, also has a lot of unique abilities to offer. Stringer’s use of noise and whammy effects in his riffs create a signature style, not to mention his mix of nu-metal, djent and metalcore sensibilities. He also has some of the thickest guitar tones I’ve ever heard live, and I was mesmerized for the full set. Stringer’s guitar work on <em>Tsunami Sea </em>is a prime example of a&nbsp; unique musician at the height of his powers.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Tsunami Sea </em>takes you on a ride. The first two tracks are all-out ragers, and after a slight respite in “Perfect Soul” and “Keep Sweet,” the album’s best song comes fifth. I’ve heard LaPlante dedicate it to “all the people I love to fucking hate,” and it’s clearly written about her enemies. It’s also the perfect example of what this band is capable of. It’s three minutes of LaPlante’s screams interlaced with plenty of Stringer’s trademark guitar work.&nbsp;</p><div><div style=\"left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;\"><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/80VTmBAnTSE?rel=0\" style=\"top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;\" allowfullscreen scrolling=\"no\" data-provider-name=\"youtube\"></iframe></div></div><p>The rest of the album showcases the band’s ability to blend dynamics, with “No Loss, No Love” and “Ride The Wave” providing the highlights on the back half of the record. The album’s title track is a great vehicle for LaPlante’s clean vocals, serving as the introduction to the album’s second act. If you’ve been enamored with Sleep Token this year like I have, give Spiritbox a go — you won’t be sorry you did. — <em>Billy Steele, Deputy Editor, Reviews</em></p><h2 id=\"914d02d0-400b-4c27-8572-6eb6ab5033d6\"><em>Bandsplain</em></h2><p>I didn’t discover <em>Bandsplain </em>in 2025, but I definitely listened to it more than any other podcast in terms of total time spent. Sure, that’s because most episodes are over three hours long, but I digress. Host Yasi Salek does a deep dive on “cult bands and iconic artists” to… ahem, bandsplain why people love them. There’s a deep catalog of back episodes, so there’s sure to be an in-depth analysis of a band you’re familiar with. But even if you think you know an artist, I’m willing to bet Salek will divulge parts of the story you weren’t aware of.&nbsp;</p><p>Jimmy Eat World’s <em>Clarity </em>is a top 5 all-timer for me, and Salek had plenty to offer about the narrative around that album I didn’t know. Her grunge series from 2024 was a history lesson I wish I’d had in middle school when I first discovered Soundgarden, Pearl Jam, Alice in Chains and the rest of the lot. An older episode about Nine Inch Nails served as the primer for me seeing the band live for the first time in September. And that’s the thing about the show: the back catalog holds up. If you’re waiting for the next installment to drop, there’s certainly something in the archives you’ll enjoy.&nbsp;</p><p>No shade to Salek’s colleagues at <em>The Ringer, </em>but the best episodes of <em>Bandsplain </em>are when the guest is a musician. Thursday front man Geoff Rickly was excellent on that Nine Inch Nails episode, and Death Cab for Cutie singer Ben Gibbard had me on the edge of my seat when he was on to discuss The La’s — a band I’d never heard of before. I’d also highly recommend the episodes on Oasis and the more recent one on Alanis Morissette. But, really, you can’t go wrong starting from anywhere on the episode list. <em>— B.S.</em></p><h2 id=\"348e4012-5e93-4889-b389-38394040908a\">Lucy Dacus - <em>Forever is a Feeling</em>&nbsp;</h2><div><div style=\"left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;\"><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/6kRRvhAVZ84?rel=0\" style=\"top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;\" allowfullscreen scrolling=\"no\" data-provider-name=\"youtube\"></iframe></div></div><p>I remember being a teenager and hearing from an adult that they did not religiously seek out, research, evaluate and introduce new bands and songs into their lives as if all existence would cease without the life-sustaining energy of new music. I was confused, concerned and damn sure that wouldn’t happen to me.&nbsp;</p><p>You know where this story goes: Job. Kid. House. Spouse. Pets that will die if I don’t feed, walk, play with and/or medicate them. I allow the algorithm to feed me new songs but rarely does something stick, so I end up listening to tracks I bonded with in my teens and twenties.&nbsp;</p><p>This year, <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"link rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=8662230b-20ea-4e5c-af78-eeacc5a14a34&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=6dcacbf8-c8f4-4944-b5c8-3117aa1edf32&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Instagram&amp;linkText=Blossom+%26+Bones&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5pbnN0YWdyYW0uY29tL2dob3N0cmFuY2htdXNpY2Zlc3RpdmFsLyIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiNmRjYWNiZjgtYzhmNC00OTQ0LWI1YzgtMzExN2FhMWVkZjMyIiwib3JpZ2luYWxVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5pbnN0YWdyYW0uY29tL2dob3N0cmFuY2htdXNpY2Zlc3RpdmFsLyJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAcONAodm2UFPcfTTiIwK541CZC8aehAz0FvMJy73RPFM&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.instagram.com%2Fghostranchmusicfestival%2F\" data-i13n=\"elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Instagram;elmt:;cpos:2;pos:1\" data-original-link=\"https://www.instagram.com/ghostranchmusicfestival/\">Blossom &amp; Bones</a>, a three-day music festival in Ghost Ranch, New Mexico, managed to push through the churn and lodge new music into my brain. Along with my kid and some friends, I camped among some of the most beautiful landscapes imaginable and ambled over to the stage each evening for performances by Santigold, Ani DiFranco and about a dozen more.&nbsp;</p><p>Lucy Dacus, one third of the indie group Boygenius, did a one-hour set with plenty of songs from her latest album <em>Forever is a Feeling</em>. Hearing the songs for the first time, I felt like I’d been listening to them for years. Lilting harmonies and layered strings create a lovely backdrop for Dacus’s velvet voice, but there’s a sharpness to her observations about relationships, rejection and sex. I’ve been looping the album ever since. — <em>Amy Skorheim, Senior Reporter, Buying Advice</em></p><h2 id=\"357a8d1c-06b2-49ae-899f-9822adf82782\">Blanco White - “So Certain” (single)</h2><div><div style=\"left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;\"><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/8skj1w1XdFc?rel=0\" style=\"top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;\" allowfullscreen scrolling=\"no\" data-provider-name=\"youtube\"></iframe></div></div><p>Early on the last concert of the day at that same festival, Blanco White took the stage. People were aimlessly milling about and the sun hadn’t yet set. Kids were playing on the lawn and the smell from the food trucks was intense, but I was enrapt by the four people on stage. The sad violin and strummy guitars floated with the hand-beat drum out into the red hills. The music sounded like I felt: rooted and wrapped in the harsh beauty of the desert and I was really glad to take that home with me. <em>— A.S.</em></p><h2 id=\"75068a5c-9263-40b8-bf74-fdd93ea57a88\"><em>Martian Revolution&nbsp;</em></h2><p>If you&#39;re as big a nerd as I am, you might know that Leo Tolstoy didn&#39;t consider <em>War and Peace </em>to be a novel. The story is what most people read for, but in the author&#39;s mind, all the drama was a parable to illustrate his grand theory of history.</p><p>Over the last year, history podcaster Mike Duncan has accomplished a similar feat using a medium Tolstoy never imagined. Duncan&#39;s <em>Revolutions </em>podcast has covered ten different revolutionary upheavals across history, starting with the English Civil War and ending with the Russian Revolution. After wrapping up the Bolsheviks, Duncan took a few episodes to suggest a grand theory of how revolutions unfold. For a while, it seemed like that was all we&#39;d get. Then, in the middle of 2024, he started posting original sci-fi — without any indication that this tale, which followed future Martians revolting against their corporate overlords on Earth, was in any way different from the previous ten seasons.</p><p>Part of what makes the Martian Revolution so excellent is Duncan&#39;s deadpan delivery. He never once breaks character. He rattles off lists of fictional sources, apologizes for inaccuracies in prior episodes, and introduces made-up historical figures with the same gravity he once used to mention George Washington or Simon Bolivar. If you&#39;re a fan of <em>Revolutions, </em>you&#39;ll have a blast recognizing character archetypes. (Mabel Dore is the Liberal Noble! Timothy Werner is the Man of Blood!)</p><p>But the podcast is great even if you&#39;ve never listened to an episode of <em>Revolutions. </em>It has an excellent grasp of character and a sense of inevitable tragedy, but with moments of joy leavened throughout. I certainly hope we don&#39;t wind up in the megacorp-ruled future of the podcast, but if we do, it&#39;ll be a great consolation if it eventually turns out the way Duncan imagines.<em> — Sam Chapman, Senior Writer</em></p><h2 id=\"d1b2cc8f-a744-49b9-97f1-0e132570b47a\">Ron Gallo - <em>Checkmate</em>&nbsp;</h2><div><div style=\"left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;\"><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/MUc44nDVkNk?rel=0\" style=\"top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;\" allowfullscreen scrolling=\"no\" data-provider-name=\"youtube\"></iframe></div></div><p>My favorite artists are ones that surprise me, and Ron Gallo is a master of reinvention. He&#39;s dabbled in absurdist punk, psychedelia, garage rock, Beatles-tinged pop and, now, stripped-down acoustic music. This is not a genre I am typically a fan of, Elliott Smith withstanding, but <em>Checkmate</em> is something special. His lyrical prowess is off the charts here, trading his usual wordplay for simple and emotionally-gutting truisms about life, love and, well, the end of the world.&nbsp;</p><p>Of course, the lyrics wouldn&#39;t work if the songs weren&#39;t good. The songs are very good. The title track is just about the perfect love song, with a primary hook that gets lost in your head for weeks. Other tracks offer hints of Mac DeMarco, Dan Fogelberg, Kevin Morby and just about everyone else who has crafted great songs on an acoustic guitar. It&#39;s fitting that Gallo has found a home on the label Kill Rock Stars, which released so much of Elliott Smith&#39;s work back in the day. As an aside, Gallo regularly posts songs about current events on TikTok and other social media platforms, which are worth checking out if you like stuff like Jesse Welles. <em>— Lawrence Bonk, Contributing Reporter</em></p><h2 id=\"045e5129-981d-4dec-bee9-43aa358ff3b1\">De La Soul -<em> Cabin in the Sky</em></h2><div><div style=\"left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;\"><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/TQWm1hfju3Q?rel=0\" style=\"top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;\" allowfullscreen scrolling=\"no\" data-provider-name=\"youtube\"></iframe></div></div><p>There have been hip-hop albums that explored the finality and tragedy of death, but not many that truly tackled spirituality and long-term grief. De La Soul has done just that, following the passing of founding member Trugoy the Dove. This album serves as a final testament of sorts for Trugoy, as he&#39;s heavily featured throughout. In that way, <em>Cabin in the Sky</em> is reminiscent of A Tribe Called Quest&#39;s 2016 masterpiece <em>We Got It from Here... Thank You 4 Your Service</em>, which followed the death of rapper Phife Dawg.&nbsp;</p><p>Like Tribe&#39;s modern classic, <em>Cabin in the Sky</em> is filled with absolute bangers. It features standout beats by DJ Premier, Pete Rock, Trugoy, Jake One and others. The rhymes are great and all three primary De La members are given time to shine. Guest rappers like Common and Nas got the memo, delivering some of their most memorable verses in years. Heck, even Giancarlo Esposito is on board as the narrator. Some reviewers have dinged this album for being too long but, come on, that&#39;s like complaining there&#39;s too much pizza. It&#39;s De La Soul. <em>— L.B.</em></p><h2 id=\"a717515e-90c3-4e2f-9d84-9de305a72856\">FKA twigs - <em>Eusexua</em></h2><div><div style=\"left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;\"><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/KnGSVIZGkQo?rel=0\" style=\"top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;\" allowfullscreen scrolling=\"no\" data-provider-name=\"youtube\"></iframe></div></div><p>This was a really good year for new music IMO, so much that I&#39;ve been finding it pretty difficult to think back and settle on my favorite releases. But, FKA twigs&#39; <em>Eusexua</em> undeniably did some heavy lifting for me, pretty much carrying me through the first six or so months of the year without much competition, and I&#39;ve circled right back to it as the year closes. It&#39;s an album that somehow seems to meet every vibe. It&#39;ll have you in club mode and ready for a night of sweaty, filthy dancing in under three minutes, or feeling bright and upbeat like a midday walk on the first day of spring — yet it still hits when you&#39;re having a good ol&#39; car cry.&nbsp;</p><p>&quot;Girl Feels Good&quot; is for sure one of my most-played songs of the year, followed closely by &quot;Eusexua,&quot; &quot;Perfect Stranger,&quot; &quot;Keep It, Hold It&quot; and &quot;Striptease.&quot; If ever I can&#39;t decide what I&#39;m in the mood to listen to, I throw this album on and it doesn&#39;t disappoint.<em> — Cheyenne MacDonald, Weekend Editor</em></p><h2 id=\"121a7e44-5a35-427e-8ab3-8861f5b4f8e9\">Faetooth - <em>Labyrinthine</em>&nbsp;</h2><div><div style=\"left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;\"><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/q6prtDY9fQQ?rel=0\" style=\"top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;\" allowfullscreen scrolling=\"no\" data-provider-name=\"youtube\"></iframe></div></div><p>Faetooth&#39;s sophomore album, <em>Labyrinthine</em>, is face-melting, melancholic perfection. The band describes its sound as &quot;fairy doom,&quot; but don&#39;t let that first word fool you into thinking it isn&#39;t heavy as hell. <em>Labyrinthine</em> goes unbelievably hard, and will have you feeling like you&#39;re eternally wandering a cursed bog, surrounded by the wailing of the unfortunate souls who came before you. Don&#39;t believe me? Put on &quot;White Noise.&quot; This is really an album that should be enjoyed in its entirety, though, and I can&#39;t individually name half the songs on it because I tend to just keep the whole thing playing on rotation. <em>— C.M.&nbsp;</em></p><h2 id=\"50e847e0-53c8-4c3e-8d0b-af387419732d\">Orville Peck - <em>Appaloosa</em>&nbsp;</h2><div><div style=\"left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;\"><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/-Q0wlv9CRKw?rel=0\" style=\"top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;\" allowfullscreen scrolling=\"no\" data-provider-name=\"youtube\"></iframe></div></div><p>This EP is truly a testament to my ability to run my obsessions into the ground, because it only came out in mid-November and somehow landed on my most-listened wrapup for the end of the year… which was released some two weeks later. It&#39;s front-loaded with its strongest songs, a powerful and kind of haunting trio that just flows beautifully from one into the other: &quot;Dreaded Sundown,&quot; to &quot;Drift Away&quot; into &quot;Atchafalaya&quot; (ft. Noah Cyrus). As a fan of musicals, I also loved the inclusion of &quot;Maybe This Time,&quot; a cover from <em>Cabaret</em>, especially since I was pretty bummed to have missed Peck&#39;s stint as the Emcee in <em>Cabaret</em> on Broadway this summer. <em>— C.M.</em></p><h2 id=\"f81e58b3-82cd-4f8f-8669-362bf94f0357\"><em>Case 63&nbsp;</em></h2><p>I got into an audio series kick this year, and dove into shows like <em>Unicorn Girl</em>, <em>Stalked!</em> and more. But none of the dramatized fiction I listened to in 2025 had me hooked like <em>Case 63</em>. Setting aside that it’s voice-acted by A-listers Julianne Moore and Oscar Isaac, which is a phenomenal pairing that won me over on star power alone. The best thing about <em>Case 63</em> is its storytelling.&nbsp;</p><p>Moore stars as a psychologist, meeting Isaac for the first time in a prison interview. Isaac has been claiming to be a traveler of sorts, and through recorded sessions and voice notes, we hear his side of the story, as well as her reactions and ultimate involvement in the adventures. Every step of the way, particularly in the beginning, there is clear explanation as to why the exchange is being recorded. It isn’t necessary, but it’s helpful in my buying into the realism of the story.&nbsp;</p><p>It isn’t just the method and technical aspects of the storytelling, of course. Narratively, <em>Case 63</em> is a gripping ride, and thanks to its short episodes, it’s easy to binge really quickly. There is certainly a generous use of cliffhangers to help speed things along, but I found myself eager to devour the entire series in one commute. The story continued to linger in my mind days after I finished both existing seasons, and I’m hoping the new one drops soon. If you’re looking for a quick and easy sci-fi audio series, do not miss <em>Case 63</em>. —<em> Cherlynn Low, Managing Editor</em></p><h2 id=\"64a4d5af-a325-4bf8-92e0-ec7d8cfac840\"><em>Secure Love&nbsp;</em></h2><p>I spent a lot of time this year trying to learn more about my attachment style and how it shows up in all the relationships in my life. Between Stephanie Rigg’s <em>On Attachment</em> podcast, the TV show <em>Couples Therapy</em> and all the books on the topic of attachment styles, trauma and more, I’ve consumed them all. And while they’ve all been helpful in different ways, one podcast stuck out to me this year. It’s hosted by Julie Menanno, MA, LMFT, LCPC, creator of the <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"link rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=8662230b-20ea-4e5c-af78-eeacc5a14a34&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=6dcacbf8-c8f4-4944-b5c8-3117aa1edf32&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Instagram&amp;linkText=%40TheSecureRelationship&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5pbnN0YWdyYW0uY29tL3RoZXNlY3VyZXJlbGF0aW9uc2hpcC8iLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjZkY2FjYmY4LWM4ZjQtNDk0NC1iNWM4LTMxMTdhYTFlZGYzMiIsIm9yaWdpbmFsVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuaW5zdGFncmFtLmNvbS90aGVzZWN1cmVyZWxhdGlvbnNoaXAvIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAaevBNsYgk_rLmPM5tqcXE7ThzNWozvwhS8t6tIFTIhF&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.instagram.com%2Fthesecurerelationship%2F\" data-i13n=\"elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Instagram;elmt:;cpos:3;pos:1\" data-original-link=\"https://www.instagram.com/thesecurerelationship/\">@TheSecureRelationship</a> account on Instagram and the author of <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"link rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;itemId=amazon_1668012863&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=6dcacbf8-c8f4-4944-b5c8-3117aa1edf32&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;linkText=Secure+Love%3A+Create+a+relationship+that+lasts+a+lifetime&amp;custData=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&amp;signature=AQAAAbCQbf932ToPk1w2G5ARGlPo4C2APtqGjwwBO9Uc7pek&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FSecure-Love-Create-Relationship-Lifetime%2Fdp%2F1668012863\" data-i13n=\"elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:;cpos:4;pos:1\" data-original-link=\"https://www.amazon.com/Secure-Love-Create-Relationship-Lifetime/dp/1668012863\"><em>Secure Love: Create a relationship that lasts a lifetime</em></a>.&nbsp;</p><p>You can probably tell from that introduction what Menanno’s work is all about.

Each season of the podcast (it’s partway through the second as of this writing) sees Menanno work with one couple through their negative cycles, using somatic practices to help each partner understand their emotions, triggers and reactions. Because we’re listening to real people talk about real-life happenings, it’s not only easy to relate, but listeners often see themselves in these scenarios. At the start of each episode, too, Menanno reads out or plays notes from the audience, and you can see how fellow listeners have reacted.&nbsp;</p><p>This season, for example, my friend and some other listeners seemed to really dislike Brian, the anxious male partner in this season’s pair. While I’ve certainly found some of Brian’s ways of speaking borderline offensive, I had a lot more sympathy for him as I started seeing his traits in my loved ones. I also started to identify with his partner Bethany, who Menanno typed as having an avoidant attachment style.&nbsp;</p><p>As I listened to Bethany and Brian describe the reasons they got into fights and explain where they were coming from, suddenly it felt like the world made sense. I saw similar patterns and reasonings in my own relationship, as well as those of my parents, relatives and friends.&nbsp;</p><p>It is slightly voyeuristic to listen to something so intimate, of course, but Menanno makes it all educational rather than just entertaining. She gently interrupts parts of each episode to tell the audience why she asks certain questions or what she’s attempting to achieve by asking Brian or Bethany to sit with their difficult feelings.&nbsp;</p><p>I found her method familiar, as I recently started working with a somatic coach whose approach is similar to Menanno’s, which is rooted in emotion-focused therapy (EFT). Staying with uncomfortable feelings makes me want to jump out of my skin, but being able to endure them, question why they arise and then understand where they come from is crucial to helping uncover the thinking that causes them. Sometimes they’re the result of flawed logic, catastrophic thinking or a simple lack of context, but often they’re very reasonable reactions.&nbsp;</p><p>If you’re looking to understand yourself and your emotions a bit better, or just want to get an idea of what EFT or couples therapy sounds like, I can’t recommend <em>The Secure Love Podcast</em> highly enough. <em>— C.L.</em></p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/music/what-we-listened-to-in-2025-201308584.html?src=rss",

Whether it&#39;s a slim folio case, an Apple Pencil, a docking station or a paper-like screen protector, there are so many iPad accessories out there that can transform how you use your tablet on a regular basis — and make your iPad last longer, too.

There are a couple of ways to do this: first, you can check the back of your tablet for its model number, which will start with an “A” and end with a series of numbers. You can also go into Settings on your iPad, then General and look up the model number in the top section. If you see a series of letters and numbers with a slash (“/“) in it, just tap that to reveal the iPad’s true model number.</p> <span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span>\n<p>The most important iPad details to consider before buying accessories are the charging port, screen size and Apple Pencil compatibility. Most iPads now have USB-C charging, save for the now discontinued 9th-gen iPad that still requires a Lightning cable.

They pull double-duty: Not only do they act as a first line of defense if your iPad goes careening onto concrete, but they can also enhance the digital drawing and writing experience. Using a stylus on an iPad is strange at first because gliding the stylus nib over a glass surface feels nothing like “normal” writing. Matte screen protectors can get closer to replicating the pen-on-paper experience, and they also prevent the stylus nib from wearing down as quickly.</p> \n<p>\n <core-commerce id=\"096ee51d507446e58275b58455543392\" data-type=\"product-list\" data-original-url=\"https://www.amazon.com/PaperLike-Pieces-iPad-2020-10-9/dp/B0BJKQ4T6B?ref_=ast_sto_dp&amp;th=1&amp;psc=1\"></core-commerce></p> \n<p>\n <core-commerce id=\"13f27d1d0d444247a1da1671b1c13aff\" data-type=\"product-list\" data-original-url=\"https://www.amazon.com/BELLEMOND-SET-Protector-compatible-WIPD129PLK/dp/B08JFXGMD7?th=1\"></core-commerce></p> \n<p>\n <core-commerce id=\"8b17ec92ec5e413a85bd60479a04b134\" data-type=\"product-list\" data-original-url=\"https://pen.tips/collections/products/products/penmat?variant=43000769544439\"></core-commerce></p> \n<p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/computing/accessories/best-ipad-accessories-130018595.html?src=rss",

There&#39;s a 39-inch OLED (39GX950B) that includes the aforementioned AI upscaling to 5K, but also algorithms for scene optimization and sound. The company says this will &quot;refine images and audio performance for a more immersive audiovisual experience.&quot;</p>\n<p>This monitor can easily switch from the standard resolution with a refresh rate of 165Hz to a much zippier WFHD resolution with a refresh rate of 330Hz. This is supported by a 0.03ms response time.

This display has been &quot;designed to dramatically improve blooming control&quot;, which is done by minimizing halo effects and stuffing in 2,304 local dimming zones. LG promises it &quot;preserves fine details across bright and dark scenes alike.&quot;</p>\n<p>This one features AI algorithms for upscaling to 5K, scene optimization and sound. It can also switch between 165Hz at 5K and 330Hz at QHD, with a 1ms response time. The screen boasts a peak brightness of 1,250 nits.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-12/03ac5070-e279-11f0-bdd6-6003f9c9164c\" data-crop-orig-src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-12/03ac5070-e279-11f0-bdd6-6003f9c9164c\" style=\"height:1226px;width:2200px;\" alt=\"A display.\" data-uuid=\"956ff9d8-04b6-348a-93c3-2f089ed869a4\"><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">LG</div></figure>\n<p>Finally, there&#39;s the beastly 52-inch (52G930B) large-format gaming display.

The 1000R curvature wraps around the peripheral, which should be great for flying sims and stuff like that.</p>\n<p>LG hasn&#39;t released any information as to when we&#39;ll be able to get our mitts on these displays, or how much they will cost.

The move is intended to reduce the risk of collisions, putting the satellites in a region that&#39;s <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/theres-no-easy-answer-to-being-a-space-janitor-170011469.html\" data-i13n=\"cpos:2;pos:1\">less cluttered</a> and will allow them to deorbit more quickly should an incident occur.&nbsp;</p><p>&quot;Lowering the satellites results in condensing Starlink orbits, and will increase space safety in several ways,&quot; Nicolls wrote, also pointing to the coming solar minimum — a period in the sun&#39;s 11ish-year cycle when activity is lower — as one of the reasons for the move. The next solar minimum is expected to occur in the early 2030s. &quot;As solar minimum approaches, atmospheric density decreases which means the ballistic decay time at any given altitude increases - lowering will mean a &gt;80% reduction in ballistic decay time in solar minimum, or 4+ years reduced to a few months,&quot; Nicolls wrote.</p><figure><img src=\"https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/Screenshot_2026-01-01_at_9.48.02%E2%80%AFPM.jpg\" data-crop-orig-src=\"https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/Screenshot_2026-01-01_at_9.48.02%E2%80%AFPM.jpg\" style=\"height:1398px;width:1296px;\" alt=\"A screenshot of the X post by Starlink VP of engineering Michael Nicolls \" data-uuid=\"dba03a94-e10d-4521-a7eb-a02873d74bc1\"/><figcaption>A screenshot of an X post by Starlink VP of engineering Michael Nicolls announcing that satellites orbiting at around 500 kilometers will be lowered to 480km</figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\"></div></figure><p>The announcement comes a few weeks after Starlink said one of its satellites had <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/science/space/a-starlink-satellite-just-exploded-and-left-trackable-debris-120002814.html\" data-i13n=\"cpos:3;pos:1\">experienced an anomaly</a> that created some debris and sent it tumbling.

    "body": "<p>Samsung has upgraded its Freestyle portable projector for 2026. The company announced a new model, the Freestyle+, ahead of CES, touting twice the brightness of its predecessor at 430 ISO lumens, and AI-powered screen optimization features. As with Freestyles past, the Freestyle+ offers 180-degree rotation and 360-degree audio. This one also supports Q-Symphony so it&#39;ll work with some Samsung soundbars. Samsung hasn&#39;t revealed much else in the way of specs or pricing, but it&#39;ll be showing off the Freestyle+ at CES 2026, so we&#39;re likely to learn more details soon.&nbsp;</p><p>While previous iterations of Samsung&#39;s compact projector offered automatic screen adjustment features, like auto focus and auto leveling, the Freestyle+ uses AI to take optimization a step further. With AI OptiScreen, as the company is calling it, the projector offers 3D auto keystone to fix distortion on uneven or non-flat surfaces, real-time focus when the projector is moved, automatic screen fit for compatible accessories and wall calibration to reduce visual distractions from the projection surface. It&#39;ll also support Samsung&#39;s Vision AI Companion.&nbsp;</p><p>The company hasn&#39;t announced a specific release date yet for the new projector, but says it&#39;s targeting the first half of the year. It&#39;ll be released in phases globally.&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/home/home-theater/samsungs-latest-freestyle-portable-projector-is-brighter-and-smarter-014026804.html?src=rss",

It&#39;s a vertically expandable 18.1-inch large display, and passengers can even watch videos without being visible to the driver.</p>\n<p>Hyundai Mobis collaborated with German optics specialist Zeiss to develop the &quot;world&#39;s first system to utilize holographic film to transform the entire front windshield into an ultra-large display surface.&quot; It says it will begin mass production in 2029, so don&#39;t expect to see this on the market anytime soon.</p>\n<p>Beyond automotive, though, we&#39;ll also get a first-ever look at the company&#39;s new Atlas robot.

Ahead of the business&#39; upcoming appearance at CES, we&#39;ve learned a bit about what Airloom has accomplished this year and what it is aiming for next.</p><p>Rather than the very tall towers typically used for this approach, Airloom&#39;s structures are 20 to 30 meters high. They are comprised of a loop of adjustable wings that move along a track, a design that’s akin to a roller coaster. As the wings move, they generate power just like the blades on a regular wind turbine do. Airloom claims that its structures require 40 percent less mass than a traditional one while delivering the same output. It also says the Airloom&#39;s towers require 42 percent fewer parts and 96 percent fewer unique parts. In combination, the company says its approach is 85 percent faster to deploy and 47 percent less expensive than horizontal axis wind turbines. Airloom broke ground on a pilot site in June for testing out its approach and confirming how those figures work in practice. </p><p>It’s not feasible to bring a wind farm, even a small one, into CES, but Airloom will have a booth at the event with materials about its technology and engineering. While the business isn&#39;t in a consumer-facing field, the impact of Airloom&#39;s work could have a future positive impact on people if the data center boom continues.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/science/airloom-will-showcase-its-new-approach-to-wind-power-at-ces-160000063.html?src=rss",

    "title": "In 2025, quitting social media felt easier than ever",
    "body": "<p>For a tech writer, being very offline is sort of like being a marathon coach who doesn’t run. So in 2025, I tried to reverse years of studied avoidance towards the most ubiquitous technological phenomenon on earth —  I got back on social media. The change was short-lived.&nbsp;</p><p>My first exodus from the feeds took some work — disabling notifications, removing apps from my homescreen and then deleting accounts entirely. This time, the phone put itself down. The whole thing has simply lost its luster.</p><p>I started with Instagram. Every experience went like this: I’d see a single post from one of the rare family members or IRL friends who are active on the platform. Next, I was fed a sponsored post, followed by suggestions to follow randos. After that, a series of influencer videos that, admittedly, appeal to my taste (funny/absurdist women and dissertations on urban planning). That was followed up with more sponsored posts, mostly from brands I’d looked up for work. Then it’d circle back to the influencers. My eyes glazed over and I tossed the phone aside.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Years back, the platform gave off a jolt of quasi-social connection that I’d spend hours sucking up. I fed on pointless thoughts from an ex-coworker, vacation reels from a college roommate, a half-baked loaf of bread that an old friend dropped on the floor but took a picture of anyway. Now it’s a bare sliver of that stuff, shoehorned between towers of sponsored content and posts from people who make or promote their living on Instagram. The real people have left. The connection is gone. The FOMO is no more.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>I experienced some variation of the same disappointment on every platform I rejoined. When I got back on TikTok a few months <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/social-media/tiktok-is-back-in-apples-app-store-in-the-us-014013369.html\" data-i13n=\"cpos:1;pos:1\">after the ban</a>, it felt like a frenzied shopping mall. Every video seems to be about four seconds long and most are promotional and/or shoppable. YouTube Shorts is drowning in AI-generated videos, and I don’t hit up social media to watch fake footage of desperate wild animal babies clambering onto the boats of helpful humans. My life has no need for simulated toddlers admonishing their pets. Occasionally, I’d hit on something compelling: a clip from late night TV, a stupidly decadent dessert recipe, people from other countries explaining cultural subtleties.&nbsp;</p><p>But for me, these social media platforms are no longer velcro for the eyes. I remember losing focus, spending long hours on YouTube Shorts and IG. I’d look up bleary-eyed and shame-faced after hours scrolling TikTok’s For You Page. Now, after a few minutes, a bored ickiness sets in. I feel like I’m trapped in a carnival of bots hawking shampoo at me and I just want to go home.&nbsp;</p><p>It’s not a mystery how or why things feel different; The answer is always money. These billion- and trillion-dollar companies have shareholders who prize year-over-year performance over anything else. So we get more sponsored posts on Instagram.

The fact that I can’t connect with my fellow common people using their services is not surprising. The change isn’t even driving everyone away. Instagram reported more users than ever this year, to the tune of <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/social-media/instagram-reaches-3-billion-monthly-users-160554420.html\" data-i13n=\"cpos:11;pos:1\">35 percent of the planet</a>. Billions of users still scroll TikTok and watch YouTube Shorts. So maybe it’s just a me thing.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>And I have options. Over-monetization may have made me not want to engage with a few social media behemoths, but things aren’t so dire everywhere. Bluesky reminds me of Twitter before X. I take comfort in seeing posts that prove most people are as dismayed as I am over a government and wider economic system that are nakedly uninterested in serving the public. The hot takes aren’t quite as funny as they were on Twitter years back — maybe it’s just all been said before or perhaps things have gotten too dire for levity. I still don’t end up spending a lot of time on the platform, however. It’s not as weird as it was before <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/social-media/bluesky-surges-to-15-million-users-after-getting-a-million-sign-ups-in-one-week-224213573.html\" data-i13n=\"cpos:12;pos:1\">the defection</a> and I get tired of the stream of news headlines contextualized with tut-tutting and handwringing — I’m perfectly capable of doing that myself.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>It’d be easy to say that social media just isn’t my thing, but that’s not true because I can’t quit Reddit — the shining exception to my social media ennui. It feels filled with actual people. Ads exist, but in a subdued, manageable way. And every contributor, commenter and moderator I’ve come across on the app is militantly vigilant against the onslaught of artificially generated content. I also like the organizational structure. I know my Home tab will only expose me to my chosen subs and I derive great joy from happy cows, greeble-chasing cats, enigmatic night feelings and freaky abandoned spaces. I use my local subreddit r/Albuquerque daily to answer questions and keep tabs on the world (directly) around me.&nbsp;</p><p>Sadly, Reddit is an outlier, a misfit exception to the rule, and now that it’s gone <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/reddit-is-now-a-publicly-traded-company-144455403.html\" data-i13n=\"cpos:13;pos:1\">public</a>, it may follow a <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/social-media/reddit-puts-its-plans-for-paid-subreddits-on-hold-181455933.html\" data-i13n=\"cpos:14;pos:1\">similar monetization</a> push. Bluesky is tiny, new and not <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.pcmag.com/news/bluesky-figuring-out-how-to-make-money-without-spamming-you-with-ads\" data-i13n=\"cpos:15;pos:1\">yet profitable</a>, so who knows where its financial journey will lead it (though the “<a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"\" class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/bluesky-made-more-money-selling-160957010.html\" data-i13n=\"cpos:16;pos:1\">world without Caesars</a>” shirt gives us some hope).&nbsp;</p><p>There’s something lamentable about the loss of the connections we gleaned from platforms that were once compelling, engrossing and rife with the creativity of our fellow humans. Ultimately, any public-facing company that prioritizes profits over everything else has no incentive to look out for its users. So I don’t expect any of the larger social platforms to pull back on their monetization marches. For now, I’ve decided I’m comfortable with my admittedly narrow interaction with the world of social media. As a Gen-Xer, online-first wasn’t how my relationship to the world started out. And I’m pretty confident I know enough about other tech-related stuff to be useful to my editors and readers without a black belt in social.

For instance, that AI-powered car cockpit mentioned above will feature integrations with both Microsoft and NVIDIA. For instance, Bosch is touting the ability to use voice commands to join a Teams call, while the car&#39;s system will automatically activate adaptive cruise control. And it&#39;s noting that NVIDIA&#39;s software suites will help manage &quot;real-time sensor processing and vision-language models.&quot;</p>\n<p>Here&#39;s a glimpse of what the booth will look like:</p>\n<div id=\"7ca51c2098ca46a8be89fc6789ffeab8\"><div style=\"left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;\"><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/C9tKL1jFBe8?rel=0&amp;start=36\" style=\"top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;\" allowfullscreen scrolling=\"no\" data-embed-domain=\"www.youtube.com\"></iframe></div></div>\n<p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/how-to-watch-the-bosch-ces-2026-press-conference-live-130020898.html?src=rss",

If you’re looking to alter your body shape, that figure could go up as your waistline goes down since muscle weighs more than fat.</p> <span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span>\n<p>Some scales go further by providing additional metrics like visceral fat levels, giving you a more comprehensive picture of your health. Dr. Anne Swift, Director of Public Health teaching at the University of Cambridge, said “weighing yourself too often can result in [you] becoming fixated on small fluctuations day-to-day rather than the overall trend over time.” Swift added “it’s sometimes better to focus on how clothes fit, or how you feel, rather than your weight.”</p> \n<p>A meta-analysis from <a data-i13n=\"cpos:6;pos:1\" href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26742706/\">2016</a> found there may be some negative psychological impact from self weighing. A <a data-i13n=\"cpos:7;pos:1\" href=\"https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/circ.138.suppl_1.10962\">2018 study</a>, however, said there may be a positive correlation between regular weigh-ins and accelerated weight loss. It can be a minefield and I’d urge you to take real care of yourself and remember success won’t happen overnight.</p> \n<h2 id=\"jump-link-best-smart-scales-for-2026\">Best smart scales for 2026</h2> \n<p>\n <core-commerce id=\"55f3e395d8e045399b07c9d7af9846d2\" data-type=\"product-list\" data-original-url=\"https://www.amazon.com/Fitbit-FB203BK-Bluetooth-Digital-Weight/dp/B07VV6GKDS\"></core-commerce></p> \n<p>\n <core-commerce id=\"a5989e4ee75340c09e62ebcccf292e40\" data-type=\"product-list\" data-original-url=\"https://www.amazon.com/eufy-Intelligent-Bluetooth-16-Measurement-Multi-Modes/dp/B0BRBZRTM2/\"></core-commerce></p> \n<p>\n <core-commerce id=\"affb9482d05c466385eb81b42f862de2\" data-type=\"product-list\" data-original-url=\"https://www.amazon.com/Garmin-Wireless-Connectivity-Measure-Muscle/dp/B08JQPRNVX\"></core-commerce></p> \n<p>\n <core-commerce id=\"7bed6c983d074ffdbc46ebe488671713\" data-type=\"product-list\" data-original-url=\"https://www.amazon.com/WITHINGS-Body-Comp-Bluetooth-Compatible/dp/B0C34ZWCXH/\"></core-commerce></p> \n<h2 id=\"jump-link-what-to-look-for-in-a-smart-scale\">What to look for in a smart scale</h2> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-weight\">Weight</h3> \n<p>A scale that measures weight is probably the top requirement, right? Whether you&#39;re after a basic weight scale or a full-featured body fat scale, bear in mind, with all these measurements, the readings won’t be as accurate as a calibrated clinical scale. It’s better to focus on the overall trend, up or down over time, rather than a single measurement in isolation. Scales offering high-precision measurements can help, especially if you’re looking at the data to inform a specific health or fitness goal.</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-connectivity\">Connectivity</h3> \n<p>Before you buy your scale, work out how you’re planning on weighing yourself and when, as it is an issue. Some lower-end smart bathroom scales connect via Bluetooth and have no internal storage, so if you don’t have your phone to hand, it won’t record your weight. If your scale has Wi-Fi, then your scale can post the data to a server, letting you access them from any compatible device. Also, you should be mindful that some smart scales aren’t built with security in mind, so there’s a small risk to your privacy should your scale be compromised.</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-bone-density\">Bone density</h3> \n<p>The stronger your bones are, the less risk you have of breaks and osteoporosis — common concerns as you get older. Clinical bone density tests use low-power x-rays and some scales can offer you an at-home approximation. These bone mass tests pass a small electrical current through your feet, measuring the resistance as it completes its journey. The resistance offered by bones, fat and muscle are all different, letting your scale identify the difference. A body composition monitor often includes this feature, too, providing a detailed breakdown of bone density, fat and muscle mass.</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-body-fat-percentage-and-muscle-mass\">Body fat percentage and muscle mass</h3> \n<p>Fat and muscle are necessary parts of our makeup, but too much of either can be problematic. Much like bone density, a body composition measurement feature can monitor your body fat and muscle mass percentages using Bioelectrical Impedance Analysis (BIA). This measurement tests how well your body resists an electrical signal passing through your body. (It’s a rough rule of thumb you should have a 30/70 percent split between fat and muscle, but please consult a medical professional for figures specific to your own body and medical needs.) For those with specific athletic goals, smart scales offer an athlete mode to better tailor readings for accuracy. If body fat monitoring is a priority, look for a model marketed as a body fat scale.</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-bmi\">BMI</h3> \n<p>A lot of scales offer a BMI calculation, and it’s easy to do since you just plot height and weight on a set graph line. Body Mass Index is, however, a problematic measurement that its critics say is both <a data-i13n=\"cpos:8;pos:1\" href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2930234/\">overly simplistic</a> and often <a data-i13n=\"cpos:9;pos:1\" href=\"https://www.pennmedicine.org/news/news-releases/2013/august/obesitymortality-paradox-demon\">greatly misleading</a>. Unfortunately, it’s also one of the most common clinical body metrics and medical professionals will use it to make judgements about your care.</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-pulse-wave-velocity\">Pulse Wave Velocity</h3> \n<p>French health-tech company Withings has offered Pulse Wave Velocity (PWV) on its flagship scale for some time, although regulatory concerns meant it was withdrawn for a period. It’s a measurement of arterial stiffness, which acts as a marker both of cardiovascular risk and other health conditions. For those looking for an even deeper understanding of their health, some scales now offer a body scan, which provides more advanced metrics such as segmental body composition and vascular health insights.</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-wearables-and-integration\">Wearables and integration</h3> \n<p>Pairing your smart scale with wearables like <a data-i13n=\"cpos:10;pos:1\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/wearables/best-fitness-trackers-133053484.html\">fitness trackers</a> or <a data-i13n=\"cpos:11;pos:1\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/best-smartwatches-153013118.html\">smartwatches</a> can further enhance your health-tracking ecosystem. Many smart scales sync directly with platforms like Fitbit or Apple Health, making it easier to track trends and analyze your data in one place.</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-display\">Display</h3> \n<p>Less a specification and more a note: Smart bathroom scales have displays ranging from pre-printed LCDs or digital dot matrix layouts through to color display screens. On the high end, your scale display can show you trending charts for your weight and other vital statistics, and can even tell you the day’s weather. If you are short-sighted, and plan on weighing yourself first thing in the morning, before you’ve found your glasses or contacts, opt for a big, clear, high-contrast display.</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-app-and-subscriptions\">App and subscriptions</h3> \n<p>You’ll spend most of your time looking at your health data through its companion scales app, and it’s vital you get a good one. This includes a clear, clean layout with powerful tools to visualize your progress and analyze your data to look for places you can improve. Given that you often don’t need to buy anything before trying the app, it’s worth testing one or two to see if you vibe with it. It’s also important you check app compatibility before making your purchase. Some health apps will only work with iOS or Android — not both. Apple Watch connectivity can also be a bonus for tracking workouts and health metrics seamlessly. Several companies also offer premium subscriptions, unlocking other features – including insights and coaching – to go along with your hardware.</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-data-portability\">Data portability</h3> \n<p>Using the same scale or app platform for years at a time means you’ll build up a massive trove of personal data. And it is (or should be), your right to take that data to another provider if you choose to move platforms in the future. Data portability is, however, a minefield, with different platforms offering wildly different options, making it easy (or hard) to go elsewhere.</p> \n<p>All of the devices in this round-up will allow you to export your data to a .CSV file, which you can then do with as you wish. Importing this information is trickier, with Withings and Garmin allowing it, and Omron, Xiaomi, Eufy and Fitbit not making it that easy. (Apps that engage with Apple Health, meanwhile, can output all of your health data in a .XML file.)</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-power\">Power</h3> \n<p>It’s not a huge issue but one worth bearing in mind that each scale will either run disposable batteries (most commonly 4xAAA) or with its own, built-in battery pack. Either choice adds an environmental and financial cost to your scale’s life — either with regular purchases of fresh cells or the potential for the whole unit to become waste when the battery pack fails.</p> \n<h2 id=\"jump-link-how-we-tested-and-which-smart-scales-we-tested\">How we tested and which smart scales we tested</h2> \n<p>For this guide, I tested six scales from major manufacturers:</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-mi-xiaomi-body-composition-scale-2\">Mi (Xiaomi) Body Composition Scale 2</h3> \n<p>Our cheapest model, Xiaomi / Mi’s Body Composition Scale 2 is as bare-bones as you can get, and it shows. It often takes a long while to lock on to get your body weight, and when it does you’ll have to delve into the Zepp Life-branded scales app in order to look at your extra data. But you can’t fault it for the basics, offering limited (but accurate) weight measurements and body composition for less than the price of a McDonald’s for four.</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-fitbit-aira-air\"><a data-i13n=\"elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:;cpos:12;pos:1\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;itemId=amazon_B07VV6GKDS&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=b2af2a56-de99-4a43-8bd9-d5e576825e83&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;linkText=Fitbit+Aira+Air&amp;custData=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&amp;signature=AQAAAdDj-ypNk63duXjFYMZLF1GZcRdUXDvoLBQxEMFoUkT_&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FFitbit-FB203BK-Bluetooth-Digital-Weight%2Fdp%2FB07VV6GKDS\" class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" data-original-link=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9GaXRiaXQtRkIyMDNCSy1CbHVldG9vdGgtRGlnaXRhbC1XZWlnaHQvZHAvQjA3VlY2R0tEUz90YWc9Z2RndDBjLXAtby1jci0yMCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiYjJhZjJhNTYtZGU5OS00YTQzLThiZDktZDVlNTc2ODI1ZTgzIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAdedVAmboPWBTWdpUHTI7X3sMt__hDB1_bW8Ef-Yq4yH&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FFitbit-FB203BK-Bluetooth-Digital-Weight%2Fdp%2FB07VV6GKDS\">Fitbit Aira Air</a></h3> \n<p>Fitbit, now part of Google, is the household name for fitness trackers and smartwatches in the US, right? If not, then it must be at least halfway synonymous with it. The Aria Air is the company’s stripped-to-the-bare bones scale, offering your weight and a few other health metrics, but you can trust that Fitbit got the basics right. Not to mention that most of the reason for buying a Fitbit product is to leverage its fitness app anyway.</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-anker-eufy-smart-scale-p2-pro\"><a data-i13n=\"elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:;cpos:13;pos:1\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;itemId=amazon_B09NHR4NX7&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=b2af2a56-de99-4a43-8bd9-d5e576825e83&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;linkText=Anker+Eufy+Smart+Scale+P2+Pro&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5hbWF6b24uY29tL2V1ZnktQmF0aHJvb20tQmx1ZXRvb3RoLU1lYXN1cmVtZW50cy1JbmNsdWRpbmcvZHAvQjA5TkhSNE5YNy8_dGFnPWdkZ3QwYy0yMCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiYjJhZjJhNTYtZGU5OS00YTQzLThiZDktZDVlNTc2ODI1ZTgzIiwib3JpZ2luYWxVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5hbWF6b24uY29tL2V1ZnktQmF0aHJvb20tQmx1ZXRvb3RoLU1lYXN1cmVtZW50cy1JbmNsdWRpbmcvZHAvQjA5TkhSNE5YNy8iLCJkeW5hbWljQ2VudHJhbFRyYWNraW5nSWQiOnRydWUsInNpdGVJZCI6InVzLWVuZ2FkZ2V0IiwicGFnZUlkIjoiMXAtYXV0b2xpbmsiLCJmZWF0dXJlSWQiOiJ0ZXh0LWxpbmsifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAYVgINAbRwRm3giJnZ1bBorlgvMu7GYl3c23mPKttCkx&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Feufy-Bathroom-Bluetooth-Measurements-Including%2Fdp%2FB09NHR4NX7%2F\" class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" data-original-link=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9ldWZ5LUJhdGhyb29tLUJsdWV0b290aC1NZWFzdXJlbWVudHMtSW5jbHVkaW5nL2RwL0IwOU5IUjROWDcvP3RhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLWNyLTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJiMmFmMmE1Ni1kZTk5LTRhNDMtOGJkOS1kNWU1NzY4MjVlODMifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAQkVA5ofcfXgBHkGUcOOXsKMlPTtBM0pu-dOKiWpfQM9&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Feufy-Bathroom-Bluetooth-Measurements-Including%2Fdp%2FB09NHR4NX7%2F\">Anker Eufy Smart Scale P2 Pro</a></h3> \n<p>Eufy’s Smart Scale P2 Pro has plenty of things to commend it – the price, the overall look and feel (it’s a snazzy piece of kit) and what it offers. It offers a whole host of in-depth functionality, including Body Fat, Muscle Mass, Water Weight, Body Fat Mass and Bone Mass measurements, as well as calculating things like your Heart Rate and Basal Metabolic Rate (the amount of calories you need to eat a day to not change weight at all) all from inside its app. In fact, buried beneath the friendly graphic, the scale offers a big pile of stats and data that should, I think, give you more than a little coaching on how to improve your overall health.</p> \n<p>It’s worth noting that Anker – Eufy’s parent company – was identified as having misled users, and the media, about the security of its products a few years back. Its Eufy-branded security cameras, which the company says does not broadcast video outside of your local network, was found to be allowing third parties to access streams online. Consequently, while we have praised the Eufy Smart Scale for its own features, we cannot recommend it without a big caveat.</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-omron-bcm-500-body-composition-and-scale-with-bluetooth\"><a data-i13n=\"elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:;cpos:14;pos:1\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;itemId=amazon_B07WHMBH8K&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=b2af2a56-de99-4a43-8bd9-d5e576825e83&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;linkText=Omron+BCM-500+Body+Composition+and+Scale+with+Bluetooth&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5hbWF6b24uY29tL09tcm9uLUNvbXBvc2l0aW9uLU1vbml0b3ItQmx1ZXRvb3RoLUNvbm5lY3Rpdml0eS9kcC9CMDdXSE1CSDhLP3RhZz1nZGd0MGMtMjAiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6ImIyYWYyYTU2LWRlOTktNGE0My04YmQ5LWQ1ZTU3NjgyNWU4MyIsIm9yaWdpbmFsVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9PbXJvbi1Db21wb3NpdGlvbi1Nb25pdG9yLUJsdWV0b290aC1Db25uZWN0aXZpdHkvZHAvQjA3V0hNQkg4SyIsImR5bmFtaWNDZW50cmFsVHJhY2tpbmdJZCI6dHJ1ZSwic2l0ZUlkIjoidXMtZW5nYWRnZXQiLCJwYWdlSWQiOiIxcC1hdXRvbGluayIsImZlYXR1cmVJZCI6InRleHQtbGluayJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAWE-PF1FIn0SfsfHN5zib4pWHzpKvbnqRagnX09i-stV&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FOmron-Composition-Monitor-Bluetooth-Connectivity%2Fdp%2FB07WHMBH8K\" class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" data-original-link=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NmVhNTY3YS1jOTg3LTRjMmUtYTJmZi0wMjkwNGVmZGU2ZWEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9PbXJvbi1Db21wb3NpdGlvbi1Nb25pdG9yLUJsdWV0b290aC1Db25uZWN0aXZpdHkvZHAvQjA3V0hNQkg4Sz90YWc9Z2RndDBjLXAtby1jci0yMCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiYjJhZjJhNTYtZGU5OS00YTQzLThiZDktZDVlNTc2ODI1ZTgzIn0&amp;signature=AQAAASi75Tjd0SgYfb-B9rkmhg6WTzW1HyxGlJthfPDFT3f3&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FOmron-Composition-Monitor-Bluetooth-Connectivity%2Fdp%2FB07WHMBH8K\">Omron BCM-500 Body Composition and Scale with Bluetooth</a></h3> \n<p>Given its role in making actual medical devices, you know what you’re getting with an Omron product.

A smart scale, on the other hand, does much more. Not only does it give you your weight measurements, but it can also track things like your body fat percentage, muscle mass, and even your BMI. Some smart scales even monitor more advanced metrics like bone density, depending on the model.</p> \n<p>What’s even better is that smart scales sync with scales apps on your phone using Wi-Fi or Bluetooth, so you can see all your health data in one place. This lets you monitor trends over time, like if your muscle mass is increasing or your body fat percentage decreasing.</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-how-do-smart-scales-work-with-more-than-one-person-using-it\">How do smart scales work with more than one person using it?</h3> \n<p>When more than one person in a household uses the smart scale, it usually recognizes each person by their weight range and other body measurements (like body fat percentage). Most smart scales allow you to set up individual profiles in the companion app, and once your profile is linked, the scale can automatically figure out who’s standing on it.</p> \n<p>Let’s say you and a family member have fairly different weights — the scale will easily know who’s who based on that. But if you and someone else have similar weights, it might ask you to confirm the profile on your phone after the weigh-in. Some scales even let you assign a profile manually in the scales app if it’s not sure.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/home/smart-home/best-smart-scale-160033523.html?src=rss",

    "title": "Instagram chief: AI is so ubiquitous 'it will be more practical to fingerprint real media than fake media'",
    "body": "<p>It&#39;s no secret that AI-generated content <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/techs-biggest-winners-of-2025-180000177.html\" data-i13n=\"cpos:1;pos:1\">took over</a> our social media feeds in 2025. Now, Instagram&#39;s top exec Adam Mosseri has made it clear that he expects AI content to overtake non-AI imagery and the significant implications that shift has for its creators and photographers.</p><p>Mosseri shared the thoughts in <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.threads.com/@mosseri/post/DS76UiklIDf/media\" data-i13n=\"cpos:2;pos:1\">a lengthy post</a> about the broader trends he expects to shape Instagram in 2026. And he offered a notably candid assessment on how AI is upending the platform. &quot;Everything that made creators matter—the ability to be real, to connect, to have a voice that couldn’t be faked—is now suddenly accessible to anyone with the right tools,&quot; he wrote. &quot;The feeds are starting to fill up with synthetic everything.&quot;</p><p>But Mosseri doesn&#39;t seem particularly concerned by this shift. He says that there is &quot;a lot of amazing AI content&quot; and that the platform may need to rethink its approach to labeling such imagery by &quot;fingerprinting real media, not just chasing fake.&quot;</p><p>From Mosseri (emphasis his):</p><blockquote><p>Social media platforms are going to come under increasing pressure to identify and label AI-generated content as such. All the major platforms will do good work identifying AI content, but they will get worse at it over time as AI gets better at imitating reality. There is already a growing number of people who believe, as I do, that<strong> it will be more practical to fingerprint real media than fake media</strong>. Camera manufacturers could cryptographically sign images at capture, creating a chain of custody.</p></blockquote><p>On some level, it&#39;s easy to understand how this seems like a more practical approach for Meta. As we&#39;ve previously reported, technologies that are meant to identify AI content, like watermarks, have proved unreliable at best. They are <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/researchers-say-current-ai-watermarks-are-trivial-to-remove-204414059.html\" data-i13n=\"cpos:3;pos:1\">easy to remove</a> and even easier to ignore altogether. Meta&#39;s own labels are <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/social-media/meta-hides-warning-labels-for-ai-edited-images-143004313.html\" data-i13n=\"cpos:4;pos:1\">far from clear</a> and the company, which has spent tens of billions of dollars on AI this year alone, has admitted it <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/social-media/the-oversight-board-calls-metas-uneven-ai-moderation-incoherent-and-unjustifiable-100056893.html\" data-i13n=\"cpos:5;pos:1\">can&#39;t reliably detect</a> AI-generated or manipulated content on its platform.</p><p>That Mosseri is so readily admitting defeat on this issue, though, is telling. AI slop has won. And when it comes to helping Instagram&#39;s 3 billion users understand what <em>is</em> real, that should largely be someone else&#39;s problem, not Meta&#39;s. Camera makers — presumably phone makers and actual camera manufacturers — should come up with their own system that sure sounds a lot like watermarking to &quot;to verify authenticity at capture.&quot; Mosseri offers few details about how this would work or be implemented at the scale required to make it feasible.</p><p>Mosseri also doesn&#39;t really address the fact that this is likely to alienate the many photographers and other Instagram creators who have already grown frustrated with the app. The exec regularly fields complaints from the group who want to know why Instagram&#39;s algorithm doesn&#39;t consistently surface their posts to their on followers.</p><p>But Mosseri suggests those complaints stem from an outdated vision of what Instagram even is. The feed of &quot;polished&quot; square images, he says, &quot;is dead.&quot; Camera companies, in his estimation, are &quot;are betting on the wrong aesthetic&quot; by trying to &quot;make everyone look like a professional photographer from the past.&quot; Instead, he says that more &quot;raw&quot; and &quot;unflattering&quot; images will be how creators can prove they are real, and not AI. In a world where Instagram has more AI content than not, creators should prioritize images and videos that intentionally make them look bad.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/social-media/instagram-chief-ai-is-so-ubiquitous-it-will-be-more-practical-to-fingerprint-real-media-than-fake-media-202620080.html?src=rss",

That&#39;s because the traditional end-of-press-day slot isn&#39;t just Sony, but rather Sony Honda Mobility — the joint venture responsible for the Afeela 1 electric car that has been showcased at CES for the better part of a decade.

But so many more important details were confirmed in the past couple of years, including the price, which starts at a staggering $89,900. However, the earlier impressions were less than impressive, and as of CES 2025, that thought remains the same.

Its CES booth will showcase &quot;several Afeela 1 pre-production vehicles in multiple color variations, alongside a new Afeela concept model,&quot; Sony Honda Mobility <a data-i13n=\"cpos:4;pos:1\" href=\"https://www.shm-afeela.com/en/news/2025-11-20/\">said in a press release</a>.</p>\n<p>We&#39;re hoping to hear about what&#39;s new and improved at CES 2026, and we&#39;re also excited to see its newest concept model.

LG, for example, has said it will <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/home/home-theater/lg-will-debut-its-first-micro-rgb-television-at-ces-010037923.html\" data-i13n=\"cpos:14;pos:1\">debut its first Micro RGB television at CES</a>. While details are scarce, the company’s press release for the LG Micro RGB evo did confirm it has received certifications by Intertek for 100 percent color gamut coverage in DCI-P3 an Adobe RGB, and that it has more than a thousand dimming zones for brightness control. </p><p>Elsewhere in the TV space, LG is throwing its hat into the “art TV” ring that Samsung pioneered with its Frame TVs: The <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/home/home-theater/lg-to-unveil-a-canvas-style-tv-at-ces-2026-010024691.html\" data-i13n=\"cpos:15;pos:1\">LG Gallery TV</a> will debut in 55- and 65-inch screen sizes, and it will of course show off various artwork when it’s not otherwise in use.

Next year, Samsung is expanding the range with 55-, 65-, 75-, 85-, 100- and 115-inch models that use the next evolution of the company’s Micro RGB technology. </p><p>Samsung is also countering LG’s 5K monitors with a <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/computing/accessories/samsungs-latest-odyssey-gaming-monitor-has-a-32-inch-6k-screen-with-glasses-free-3d-130051748.html\" data-i13n=\"cpos:22;pos:1\">6K model</a> that aims to deliver glasses-free 3D (another long-time CES staple).

    "body": "<p>Chances are that if a VPN is marketed to everyday users, it more or less runs itself. As long as you go with one of the <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/best-vpn-130004396.html\" data-i13n=\"cpos:1;pos:1\">best VPNs</a> instead of setting up your own manual connection, the interface is likely built so you have to engage with it as little as possible. Generally, if you find yourself constantly thinking about your VPN while using it — as happened to me with <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/norton-vpn-review-a-vpn-that-fails-to-meet-nortons-standards-170037086.html\" data-i13n=\"cpos:2;pos:1\">Norton VPN</a> — that&#39;s a bad thing and you should change providers.</p><p>That said, it&#39;s still useful to get a high-level view of how to use a VPN, especially if you&#39;ve never used one before. In this article, I&#39;ll walk you through how to download, install and configure a VPN on any platform and how to choose servers for specific situations. I&#39;ll also discuss specific steps for desktop and laptop computers, phones, tablets, smart TVs, game consoles and routers.</p><h2 id=\"e5ae9320-9e97-41d7-9412-e57ddfe9f8d5\">How to download and install a VPN</h2><p>There are over 100 VPNs available on the internet and the two big mobile app stores, but most of them follow a similar approach to download and installation. Except for certain <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/best-free-vpn-120032818.html\" data-i13n=\"cpos:3;pos:1\">free VPNs</a>, you&#39;ll need to create an account on the VPN provider&#39;s website, install the VPN client, then use your account to log in. Here are the steps.</p><ol><li><p>In a web browser, navigate to a VPN provider&#39;s website. For suggestions on where to start, check out our list of the <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/deals/the-best-vpn-deals-up-to-88-percent-off-protonvpn-surfshark-expressvpn-nordvpn-and-more-120056445.html\" data-i13n=\"cpos:4;pos:1\">best VPN deals</a>. Click any link that mentions getting the VPN or claiming the deal — as a rule, they aren&#39;t hard to find.</p></li><li><p>Select a plan based on the length of time you need the VPN for, the features you want and the number of devices you&#39;d like to use the VPN on simultaneously. Add a payment method. You&#39;ll be prompted to create the username and password for a new account.</p></li><li><p><strong>On desktop</strong>, you can start with the Mac or Windows app store, though some VPNs require a download directly from their respective website. That’s generally the way to get the most feature-rich version of the VPN, but just make sure you’re downloading from the provider’s website to ensure you don’t get a malicious copycat. <strong>On mobile</strong>, the app store is your only choice, but don&#39;t forget to check the reviews and make sure you&#39;re getting the service you paid for — unfortunately, rival (and sometimes less scrupulous) VPN brands can use paid placements to appear higher on search results, even for a rival product. </p></li><li><p>Follow the pre-programmed installation flow. Again, don&#39;t let a VPN make any changes to your system if you haven&#39;t thoroughly vetted the provider (or gone with one of our recommendations). If it&#39;s safe, allow the VPN all the setup permissions it needs.</p></li><li><p>Finally, open the VPN client and sign in with the credentials you created in step two. You&#39;re now ready to start using your new VPN.</p></li></ol><figure><img src=\"https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/Downloading_Surfshark_on_Mac.png\" data-crop-orig-src=\"https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/Downloading_Surfshark_on_Mac.png\" style=\"height:869px;width:1829px;\" alt=\"Surfshark in Mac downloads folder\" data-uuid=\"56f3ed7f-7483-4fc3-aed9-c2e389da2de0\"><figcaption>Surfshark in Mac downloads folder</figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Sam Chapman for Engadget</div></figure><p>With so many VPNs on the market, this process won&#39;t always be the same. Sometimes you&#39;ll have to make the account before paying, and some mobile VPNs let you handle the whole process in-app. What&#39;s always true, though, is that a good VPN will make the signup flow as easy as possible. If you have trouble before you even log in, that&#39;s a red flag.</p><h3 id=\"eab57cd3-f062-45cc-b880-91db0fe05fa4\">How to configure a VPN app</h3><p>Most VPNs are ready to go out of the box. However, even if you don&#39;t think you&#39;re a power user, it&#39;s a good idea to go through the settings and make sure they match what you need. Here are a few steps I recommend taking.</p><ol><li><p>Activate the kill switch. This feature monitors your connection to the VPN server. If it ever drops — either from problems in the server, your client or somewhere in between — the kill switch instantly cuts off your internet until your VPN connection is restored. This saves you from accidentally broadcasting anything sensitive while also ensuring you only connect to legitimate VPN servers (avoiding the <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.tunnelvisionbug.com/\" data-i13n=\"cpos:5;pos:1\">Tunnelvision bug</a>).</p></li><li><p>Set up favorites and profiles. VPNs usually let you select servers you&#39;ll use regularly, websites you&#39;ll often connect to through the VPN and other preferences that will appear immediately when you open the app. Some go further, like <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/proton-vpn-review-2025-a-nonprofit-service-with-premium-performance-153046073.html\" data-i13n=\"cpos:6;pos:1\">Proton VPN</a>, which lets you create user profiles that bundle several preferences together.</p></li><li><p>Decide if you want the VPN to automatically launch and connect when you start up your computer.</p></li><li><p>Check on split tunneling. There may be cases where you want a certain app or site to work outside the VPN, or where you want everything to go unencrypted except one site or app. You can set up a split tunnel when you need it, but if there&#39;s one you know you&#39;ll use regularly, it helps to build it early.</p></li><li><p>Activate or deactivate any content blockers the VPN comes with, including ad blockers, malware detectors and parental controls, as you see fit.</p></li><li><p>Decide whether you want the VPN to send you notifications, and how.</p></li><li><p>Select a VPN protocol. It&#39;s almost always best to let the VPN choose for itself, but it&#39;s helpful to at least know where the protocol-switching option is. Occasionally, if one protocol isn&#39;t working, you can troubleshoot by selecting another.</p></li></ol><p>You can do all this by digging into your VPN&#39;s preferences control panel. A gear seems to be the universal icon for that, but Mac users may also find it by picking &quot;preferences&quot; or &quot;settings&quot; from the menu bar. When you find the preferences menu, go through each tab in turn and make sure everything is the way you like it.</p><h3 id=\"511e0968-4f3a-4690-aad7-bfb431046f9b\">How to choose a VPN server</h3><p>Picking a server location is the final box to check before connecting. You nearly always have the option of letting the VPN pick the best server. Most apps tend to determine the best server with a latency test, so it will almost always be a node very close to your physical location.</p><p>If you just want anonymity online, that&#39;s fine — it doesn&#39;t matter which IP address you use as long as it&#39;s not your real one. But several VPN use cases do require a specific server location. For those, follow one simple rule: Pick a server in the place you want your signal to come from.</p><figure><img src=\"https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/Surfshark_for_How_to_Use.png\" data-crop-orig-src=\"https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/Surfshark_for_How_to_Use.png\" style=\"height:1188px;width:1588px;\" alt=\"Choosing locations on Surfshark\" data-uuid=\"ad20ffff-2e09-42e7-93d3-bcae41563393\"><figcaption>Choosing locations on Surfshark</figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Sam Chapman for Engadget</div></figure><p>For example, let&#39;s say you want to watch <em>The Office, </em>but you&#39;re only subscribed to Netflix and not Peacock. Luckily, Netflix is licensed to show <em>The Office </em>in the U.K. If you connect to a British server location before opening Netflix, you&#39;ll be able to access the show without paying for an extra subscription. (Of course, make sure VPNs aren’t expressly banned by the streaming service’s terms of service before accessing it while using one.)</p><p>Other than streaming, the most common reason you&#39;ll need a specific VPN server is to get around firewalls that block websites. Whether it&#39;s your school doing the censorship, your workplace or your entire state, the solution is the same: Pick a VPN server outside the restricted region. Censorship systems filter by location — they can&#39;t block where they don&#39;t have jurisdiction. Get a new virtual location and you should be free and clear. (Always be cognizant of the laws on VPN usage in your location before activating them.)</p><h3 id=\"5ea22123-706d-4712-80ee-c4c41d00eaa2\">When to use a VPN (and when not to)</h3><p>It&#39;s good to get into the habit of connecting to your VPN whenever you get online. You can never be sure what information your ISP is gathering on you. If you&#39;re using unprotected Wi-Fi, or a public network with a clearly visible password, anybody might be listening in. Even if you don&#39;t need a particular location, always be using your VPN.</p><p>The only reason you might want to be online without a VPN is that certain websites, especially online banks, get suspicious if they note repeated logins to the same account from too many different IP addresses. For those cases, you can either set up a split tunnel to exclude the website from encryption, or temporarily turn your VPN off altogether.</p><h2 id=\"1254cc3e-6927-44fa-9785-06bcc25cbd13\">Instructions for specific devices</h2><p>Although most VPNs try to keep their apps similar on every platform, the strictures of differing hardware and software lead them to install and operate differently. In case you still have questions after reading the general guide above, this section goes into detail on every platform where you might use a VPN.</p><h3 id=\"69d7feab-ae9f-4c04-b668-4b23ed247ede\">How to use a VPN on desktop</h3><p>After subscribing to a VPN on <strong>Windows</strong>, you should be directed to download an EXE file — if this doesn&#39;t happen, log into your account on the website and find the downloads center. Find the folder where the EXE is saved, double-click it and follow the onscreen instructions.</p><p>On <strong>Mac</strong>, the process is more or less the same, except you&#39;ll usually get a PKG file instead of an EXE. Go to your downloads folder (either in Finder or through your web browser) and double-click the PKG file. Grant the VPN whatever permissions it needs. (Again, this is why it’s important to only use a legitimate vendor, such as the ones we recommend.)</p><p>Once installed, you can open the VPN client at any time by double-clicking the icon again. Some VPNs open as separate windows, while others will add icons to your toolbar. This often varies by platform; if you&#39;re concerned that your VPN doesn&#39;t look like a screenshot you&#39;ve seen, check which operating system the image comes from.</p><h3 id=\"6a9b37a7-441d-49e7-994c-5701c621aa09\">How to use a VPN on mobile</h3><p>On <strong>Android </strong>and <strong>iOS</strong>, you&#39;ll download your VPN app through the Google Play Store or Apple App Store, respectively. Even if you get started through a mobile browser, it will probably redirect you to the app store for the actual download and installation.</p><p>Follow the usual step for downloading an app: search for its name in the app store, click &quot;Get&quot; or &quot;Install,&quot; then let your phone cook. As always, so long as it&#39;s a vetted VPN, grant it the permissions it needs. You may be able to download and install the VPN first, then create your account and submit payment through the app afterward.</p><p>One final note: several leading VPNs offer free trials for mobile users. If you see a button that says something like &quot;get free trial,&quot; you may be able to use the VPN for several days without paying. Just be warned that if the trial lapses, you might get automatically signed up for a plan that&#39;s longer than you&#39;d like.</p><h3 id=\"ba5edfbb-5471-45fc-9fc0-70bc182b1fad\">How to use a VPN browser extension</h3><p>VPNs offer browser extensions as lightweight versions of their main clients. While a desktop or mobile VPN reroutes everything that device sends to the internet, a browser extension only protects traffic through your web browser. You can use one as a primitive form of split tunneling, but they&#39;re mainly for basic convenience — most of what you do online goes through a browser, so it&#39;s nice to be able to protect your connection without opening a separate app.</p><figure><img src=\"https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/NordVPN_browser_extension.png\" data-crop-orig-src=\"https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/NordVPN_browser_extension.png\" style=\"height:1352px;width:2673px;\" alt=\"NordVPN browser extension on Chrome\" data-uuid=\"a448ba0a-eb2d-4c2f-8d5a-75d05e9b58ad\"><figcaption>NordVPN browser extension on Chrome</figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Sam Chapman for Engadget</div></figure><p>To use a VPN browser extension, just create your account as normal, then download the extension from your VPN&#39;s website. You can manage it from your browser&#39;s extensions center. That&#39;s a jigsaw piece at the top-right corner on most browsers, including Chrome, Edge and Firefox.</p><h3 id=\"281a98b7-ad86-42d8-960c-427b3d41fb36\">How to use a VPN on a smart TV</h3><p>You can use a VPN to change your location and stream international content directly to a smart TV. The catch is that not all smart TV brands support VPN apps. For those that don&#39;t, <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/how-to-add-vpn-to-your-tv-143736648.html\" data-i13n=\"cpos:7;pos:1\">you&#39;ll have to find a workaround</a>.</p><p>The good news is that a ton of the best smart TVs can natively host VPNs, including <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/how-to-use-a-vpn-on-chromecast-or-google-tv-140619467.html\" data-i13n=\"cpos:8;pos:1\">Google TV</a>, Android TV, <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/how-to-add-a-vpn-on-fire-tv-101822833.html\" data-i13n=\"cpos:9;pos:1\">Amazon Fire TV</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/how-to-use-a-vpn-on-apple-tv-113345245.html\" data-i13n=\"cpos:10;pos:1\">Apple TV</a> (though only tvOS 17 and above).

You can also install a VPN on your router (see below) so your smart TV automatically uses the router&#39;s location.</p><p>Finally, you can get a temporary fix by using your computer as a Wi-Fi hotspot while it has a VPN active.

If you want to use a VPN while gaming — and I recommend that for safety if you&#39;re planning to play online — you can use two of the same methods that work for a smart TV: install a VPN on your router, or get your console online through a Mac or PC hotspot.</p><h3 id=\"348a0322-4456-4ddf-8252-083e29f2d15e\">How to install a VPN on a router</h3><p>When you install a router VPN, anything that gets online through your home network will be protected, including game consoles, TVs and smart devices that don&#39;t support VPNs natively. It&#39;s not a process for the faint of heart, though. You&#39;ll need to get a new router and potentially install VPN firmware on it yourself. If you want to go this route, the easiest option is to get an <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"link rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=4255ebf1-6185-403e-9be2-91ab47ad1ac3&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=52aa4501-7372-4990-ab5c-a027e398a215&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=ExpressVPN&amp;linkText=ExpressVPN+Aircove+router&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5leHByZXNzdnBuLmNvbS9haXJjb3ZlPyIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiNTJhYTQ1MDEtNzM3Mi00OTkwLWFiNWMtYTAyN2UzOThhMjE1Iiwib3JpZ2luYWxVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5leHByZXNzdnBuLmNvbS9haXJjb3ZlPyJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAQcQcoBXc2t-ZvPzzwUVEtcI1Gdh5Zyj_vAr0g6ymVzJ&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.expressvpn.com%2Faircove%3F\" data-i13n=\"elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:ExpressVPN;elmt:;cpos:13;pos:1\" data-original-link=\"https://www.expressvpn.com/aircove?\">ExpressVPN Aircove router</a> — not only does it come with all the settings done for you, but it can be managed through the same clean interface as ExpressVPN&#39;s other apps.</p><p>We don&#39;t have space here to go through the entire process, but here&#39;s a general overview. First, get a router with firmware that supports VPN configurations — most ISP default routers don&#39;t, so you&#39;ll have to go third-party.</p><p>Next, go to the downloads center of your VPN&#39;s website and look for the section with VPN configurations. A &quot;configuration&quot; is a complete set of the information needed to access a certain VPN server through a certain protocol — say, a Proton VPN server in Arizona through OpenVPN. Download a configuration file for the protocol and location you want all your home devices to connect through.</p><p>Finally, open your router control panel by entering your router&#39;s IP address into a web browser address bar, then log in with your router credentials (these should be marked on the router itself unless you&#39;ve changed them). Go to the VPN tab — which should be there if it&#39;s a router with VPN firmware — and upload the profile you downloaded from the VPN website. Use the same router control panel to activate and deactivate the router VPN connection.</p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/how-to-use-a-vpn-140000564.html?src=rss",

However, I’m still a big believer in compact cameras. They’re a noticeable step up from smartphones quality-wise, and a lot of people will take a compact traveling or to events when they’d never bother with the hassle of a DSLR or mirrorless camera.</p> \n<p>Compacts largely have type 1-inch sensors, but a few offer larger options, particularly Fujifilm’s XF-100V. Another popular model, Sony’s XV-1, is primarily aimed at content creators looking to step up. In any case, desirable qualities include image quality, a fast lens, relatively long zoom, flip-out display, good battery life, a high quality EVF, decent video and good pocketability.</p> \n<p>\n <core-commerce id=\"cd03eff4cbdc4130bf293bf0147c94d1\" data-type=\"product-list\" data-original-url=\"https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1811352-REG/fujifilm_16821822_x100vi_digital_camera_silver.html\"></core-commerce></p> \n<p>\n <core-commerce id=\"1e50f52ddf4d41d6aee53f485e29a24c\" data-type=\"product-list\" data-original-url=\"https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Camera-Content-Creators-Vloggers/dp/B0C62F451G\"></core-commerce></p> \n<h2 id=\"jump-link-what-to-consider-before-choosing-a-camera\">What to consider before choosing a camera</h2> \n<p>Though smartphones get better for video and photos every year, full cameras still have an edge in many ways. The larger sensors in mirrorless cameras let more light in, and you have a wide choice of lenses with far superior optics. Dedicated cameras are also faster for shooting things like sports or wildlife, offer superior video for content creators and create more professional results.</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-sensor-size\">Sensor size</h3> \n<p>There are a few key things to consider to get the most out of a camera. The first is sensor size: in general, the larger the sensor, the better (and usually more expensive) the camera.</p> \n<p>Full frame is the largest sensor size for mainstream cameras, and it’s available on models like the new Panasonic S9, the Nikon Z III and Canon EOS R5 II. At a size equivalent to 35mm film (36 x 24mm), it offers the best performance in terms of image quality, low-light capability and depth of field. But it’s also very expensive and finicky. While bokeh looks incredible at an aperture of f/1.4, the depth of field is so razor thin that your subject&#39;s eyebrow might be in focus but not their eye. This can also make shooting video difficult.</p> \n<p>The next size category is APS-C (around 23.5 x 15.6mm for most models and 22.2 x 14.8mm for Canon), offered on Fujifilm&#39;s X Series lineup, the Canon R10, the Sony ZV-E10 II and the Nikon Z50. It&#39;s cheaper than full frame, both for the camera body and lenses, but still brings most of the advantages like decent bokeh, high ISOs for low-light shooting and relatively high resolution. With a sensor size the same as movie cameras, it&#39;s ideal for shooting video, and it’s easier to hold focus than with full-frame cameras.</p> \n<p>Micro Four Thirds (17.3 x 13mm), a format shared by Panasonic and Olympus, is the next step down in sensor size. It offers less bokeh and light-gathering capability than APS-C and full frame, but allows for smaller and lighter cameras and lenses. For video, you can still get reasonably tight depth of field with good prime lenses, but focus is easier to control.</p> \n<p>The other common sensor size is Type 1 (1 inch), which is actually smaller than one inch at 12.7 x 9.5mm. That&#39;s used mostly by compact models like Sony’s ZV-1 vlogging camera. Finally, action cameras like the GoPro Hero 11 and DJI’s Osmo 3 have even smaller sensors (1/1.9 and 1/1.7 inches, respectively).</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-autofocus\">Autofocus</h3> \n<p>For photographers, another key factor is autofocus (AF) speed and accuracy. Most modern mirrorless cameras have hybrid phase-detect AF systems that allow for rapid focus and fast burst speeds. The majority also offer AI features like eye-detect AF for people and animals, which locks in on the subject’s eyes, face or body to keep them in focus. However, some models are faster and more reactive than others.</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-displays\">Displays</h3> \n<p>The electronic viewfinder (EVF) and rear display are also crucial. The best models have the sharpest and brightest EVFs that help you judge a shot before taking it. For things like street photography, it’s best to have as bright and sharp a rear display as possible, so it’s easy to see your subject and check focus in all manner of lighting conditions. You may also want a screen that flips out rather than just tilting, too.</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-lenses\">Lenses</h3> \n<p>DSLRs and mirrorless cameras let you change lenses, but you&#39;re stuck with what&#39;s built into a compact camera. While that&#39;s great for portability, a single lens means you&#39;re going to sacrifice <em>something</em> along the way. The Fujifilm X100V, for instance, has a fast but fixed 35mm-equivalent f/2.0 lens and no zoom. The Sony RX100 V has a 24-70mm zoom, but it&#39;s slower at the telephoto end (f/2.8) and less sharp than a fixed focal (prime) lens.</p> \n<p>When choosing a lens for a mirrorless camera, you’ll need to consider the focal or zoom length, along with the minimum aperture. Smaller numbers like f/1.4 for a prime lens or f/2.8 for a zoom are best, as they let you work in darker environments and maximize background blur to isolate your subject. However, those lenses are more complex and thus more expensive.</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-video-recording\">Video recording</h3> \n<p>When it comes to video, there are other factors to consider. Some cameras combine or skip over pixels (line skipping or pixel binning) for video recording, which is not ideal because it can reduce sharpness. Better cameras tend to read out the entire sensor and then “downsample” to improve video sharpness (camera manufacturers don’t often say if video is pixel binned, but will say if it’s downsampled). Another important factor is sensor speed, as slower sensors tend to have more rolling shutter that can create a “jello” effect that skews video.</p> \n<p>In addition, how’s the battery life? How do you like the handling and feel? How long can you shoot before the camera heats up or stops? Does it support 10-bit HDR video? Is there a microphone and/or a headphone jack? (If you record a lot of interviews, it&#39;s preferable to have both.) How&#39;s the video autofocus? All of these things play a part in your decision.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/cameras/best-cameras-151524327.html?src=rss",

In its worst-case-scenario model, the IDC predicts PC shipments could shrink by up to 8.9 percent in 2026 because of the high cost of memory.</p><p>&quot;Instead of expanding conventional DRAM and NAND used in smartphones, PCs and other consumer electronics, major memory makers have shifted production toward memory used in AI data centers, such as high-bandwidth (HBM) and high-capacity DDR5,&quot; IDC writes. That&#39;s continued to drive up the price of the RAM that is available for PC makers, which has naturally led to them to raise the price of their own products to stay above water. For example, modular PC maker Framework has already <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"link\" href=\"https://frame.work/blog/in-stock-on-framework-desktop-and-updates-on-the-industry-wide-silicon-crunch\" data-i13n=\"cpos:4;pos:1\">had to raise prices</a> on some of its laptops and parts, and says &quot;further cost and price increases are highly likely over the next months.&quot; The IDC says prices could rise by 6 to 8 percent in 2026 if its most pessimistic scenario comes true.</p><p>The timing of this RAM crunch is particularly ironic because selling <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/computing/amd-explains-its-ai-pc-strategy-123004804.html\" data-i13n=\"cpos:5;pos:1\">&quot;AI PCs&quot;</a> — computers with neural processing units that can run AI models locally — were supposed to be one of the things pulling the PC industry out of its post-pandemic slump. Instead, those computers&#39; larger RAM needs leave them more vulnerable to the effects of the AI industry itself. Computers aren&#39;t the only electronics impacted, either. The IDC says the average selling price of a smartphone could grow by 6 to 8 percent in its most pessimistic scenario, and smartphone shipments could shrink by as much as 5.2 percent.&nbsp;</p><p>Companies like Apple and Samsung, with cash to spare and long-term supply agreements, could weather these higher RAM prices and keep things consistent for a year or two, according to the IDC. For everyone else, though, the near-term is looking much more expensive, and by necessity, much less adventurous.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/computing/idc-warns-of-major-pc-market-downturn-due-to-memory-crunch-214510197.html?src=rss",

The Galaxy A17 5G starts at $199 and will be available on January 7.

The photography setup is also unchanged from last year&#39;s model, with a 50MP main camera, 5MP ultrawide, 2MP macro and 13MP selfie lenses. The base model has 4GB of RAM and 128GB of storage, but can be upgraded with up to 2TB of additional storage via microSD.

Like with the Galaxy A17 5G, the tablet can also be juiced up with additional microSD storage. Performance-wise, you&#39;ll top out at 15 hours of video playback on the battery, but fast-charging is also supported here.

Most iPad covers are cases that surround the back of your tablet and have a flap that covers the screen, so it provides protection for the body as well as its display. Plenty of iPad cases also have screen covers, but you don’t have to get one with that feature. Instead, you could just get a case that hugs the back of the tablet and nothing else. Those accessories will be marginally thinner and lighter than their cover-toting counterparts, and give your iPad a more svelte profile.</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-how-often-should-i-charge-my-ipad\">How often should I charge my iPad?</h3> \n<p>How often you charge your iPad will depend on how often you use it. Most iPads will last at least a regular work day with frequent usage, which is one of the reasons why many have opted to use their iPads as laptop replacements. But with heavy usage, like constant video streaming or gaming, will come more rapid battery drain. A good rule of thumb is to charge your iPad when you go to sleep each night, that way you’ll have a topped-up device waiting for you in the morning.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/computing/accessories/best-ipad-cases-to-protect-your-tablet-130033533.html?src=rss",

On December 17, the Senate <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/science/space/jared-isaacman-is-nasas-new-leader-220833691.html\" data-i13n=\"cpos:2;pos:1\">confirmed billionaire Jared Isaacman</a> as the agency&#39;s new administrator. He now holds the power to rehabilitate a battered engine of scientific research, or steer it towards even more disruption.&nbsp;</p><p>Considering the caliber of President Trump&#39;s other appointees, Isaacman is probably the best candidate for the job. Outside of being a successful entrepreneur, he has flown fighter jets and been to space twice as part of the <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/spacex-inspiration4-mission-full-crew-143428383.html\" data-i13n=\"cpos:3;pos:1\">Inspiration4</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/science/space/polaris-dawn-is-finally-headed-to-space-for-its-groundbreaking-civilian-mission-093346616.html\" data-i13n=\"cpos:4;pos:1\">Polaris Dawn</a> private missions. One of those flights saw him <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/science/space/the-polaris-dawn-crew-is-back-on-earth-after-a-historic-mission-142028997.html\" data-i13n=\"cpos:5;pos:1\">complete the first commercial space walk</a>, and travel farther from Earth than any human since the end of the Apollo program.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&quot;Perfect is the enemy of the good. Isaacman checks a lot of boxes,&quot; says Keith Cowing, a former NASA employee and the founder of <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"link\" href=\"https://nasawatch.com/\" data-i13n=\"cpos:6;pos:1\">NASA Watch, a blog dedicated to the agency.</a> &quot;He&#39;s passed every requirement to fly in a spacecraft that American astronauts at NASA are required to pass. He also went out of his way to have a diverse crew, and shove as much science as he could in those missions.&quot;&nbsp;</p><p>And yet if you&#39;re a NASA employee or just someone who cares about the agency&#39;s work, there are still plenty of reasons to be concerned for its future. When Trump first nominated Isaacman in the spring, the billionaire wrote a 62-page document detailing his vision for NASA. In November, <em>Politico</em> <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2025/11/03/jared-isaacman-confidential-manifesto-nasa-00633858\" data-i13n=\"cpos:7;pos:1\">obtained a copy of that plan</a>, titled Project Athena.</p><p>To some insiders, Project Athena painted a picture of someone who, at least at the time when it was written, fundamentally misunderstood how NASA works and how scientific discovery is funded in the US and elsewhere. It also suggests Isaacman may be more open to Trump&#39;s NASA agenda than would appear at first glance.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>When asked about the plan by <em>Politico</em>, one former NASA official characterized it as &quot;bizarre and careless.&quot; Another called it “presumptuous,&quot; given many of the proposed changes to the agency&#39;s structure would require Congressional approval. In one section, Isaacman recommended taking “NASA out of the taxpayer funded climate science business and [leaving] it for academia to determine.” In another section, he promised to evaluate the “relevance and ongoing necessity” of every agency center, particularly NASA&#39;s iconic Jet Propulsion Laboratory, saying the facility and others must increase the “output and time to science KPI.”&nbsp;</p><p>A lot has changed since Isaacman first wrote that document. It came before the workforce cuts, before the <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2025/11/04/science/nasa-goddard-building-closures-government-shutdown\" data-i13n=\"cpos:8;pos:1\">future of Goddard Space Flight Center</a> became uncertain and before Trump surprised everyone by renominating Isaacman. But <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2025/12/03/science/nasa-jared-isaacman-confirmation-hearing\" data-i13n=\"cpos:9;pos:1\">during his Senate testimony</a> earlier this month, the billionaire said “I do stand behind everything in the document, even though it was written seven months ago. I think it was all directionally correct.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>He did appear to distance himself from some viewpoints expressed in or inferred by Project Athena, however. Isaacman stated that “anything suggesting that I am anti-science or want to outsource that responsibility is simply untrue.” He also came out against the administration&#39;s plan to cut NASA&#39;s science budget nearly in half, claiming the proposals would <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"link\" href=\"https://spacenews.com/isaacman-calls-potential-nasa-science-cuts-not-optimal/\" data-i13n=\"cpos:10;pos:1\">not lead to &quot;an optimal outcome.&quot;</a></p><p>One thing is clear, Isaacman is not your typical bureaucrat. &quot;One of the pitfalls of some prior NASA administrators has been that they&#39;ve shown too much reverence for the internal processes and bureaucratic structure of the agency to the detriment of decision-making and performance,&quot; <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.planetary.org/profiles/casey-dreier\" data-i13n=\"cpos:11;pos:1\">said Casey Drier</a>, chief of space policy at <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.planetary.org/\" data-i13n=\"cpos:12;pos:1\">The Planetary Society</a>, a nonprofit that advocates for the exploration and study of space. &quot;Isaacman has positioned himself as the opposite of that. Clearly, that&#39;s something that could lead to a lot of political and congressional challenges if taken too far.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Even if Isaacman doesn&#39;t follow through on any of the proposals made in Project Athena, there&#39;s only so much a NASA administrator — even one sympathetic to civil servants working under them — can do.&nbsp;</p><p>&quot;Once a budget request goes out publicly, everyone in the administration has to defend it. Anything he does will have to be internal and private,&quot; Drier explains. &quot;He never explicitly criticized the administration during his hearing. He&#39;s also coming relatively late in the budget process.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>A lot of NASA&#39;s future will depend on the White House Office of Management and Budget (OMB), which is responsible for implementing the president&#39;s agenda across the executive branch. As a direct result of <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"link\" href=\"https://bipartisanpolicy.org/explainer/what-does-the-updated-omb-circular-a-11-mean-for-how-congress-appropriates-funding/\" data-i13n=\"cpos:13;pos:1\">guidance</a> the OMB issued over the summer, NASA <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.planetary.org/charts/fy-2025-nasas-rate-of-new-grants\" data-i13n=\"cpos:14;pos:1\">awarded 25 percent fewer new grants</a> in 2025 than it did on average between 2020 and 2024.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&quot;The OMB has added layers of requirements that scientists now have to go through to spend the money they&#39;ve already been allocated. The administration has worked against its own stated goals of efficiency,&quot; Drier said. &quot;Isaacman can&#39;t solve that himself. He can&#39;t tell the OMB what to do. That&#39;s going to be a serious challenge.&quot;&nbsp;</p><p>Looming over everything is the fact NASA still does not have a full-year budget for 2026. Congress has until January 30 to fund NASA and the rest of the federal government before the short-term funding bill it passed on November 12 runs out. &quot;On paper, the official policy of the administration is still to terminate a third of NASA&#39;s scientific capability,&quot; Drier points out.</p><p>There are reasons to be cautiously optimistic. Publicly, both the House and Senate have come out against Trump&#39;s funding cuts. And some science missions that were slated to be cancelled, such as <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/osiris-rex-apex-apophis-asteroid-visit-154021788.html\" data-i13n=\"cpos:15;pos:1\">OSIRIS-APEX</a>, have been approved for another full year of operations.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>What NASA needs now is someone who will, as Drier puts it, &quot;vigorously advocate&quot; for the agency in whatever way they can. It remains to be seen if that&#39;s Jared Isaacman.</p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/science/space/nasa-finally-has-a-leader-but-its-future-is-no-more-certain-201109072.html?src=rss",

Instead, think about the types of devices (phones included) that you could see yourself using in the near future. If you’re sure you’ll use iPhones for a long time, an Apple MagSafe-compatible magnetic wireless charger will be faster and more convenient. If you use Android phones or think you might switch sides, however, you’ll want a more universal design. If you have other accessories like wireless earbuds or a smartwatch that supports wireless charging, maybe you’d be better off with a <a data-i13n=\"cpos:7;pos:1\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/computing/accessories/best-multi-device-wireless-charging-pads-120557582.html\">3-in-1 wireless charger</a> or full wireless charging station.</p> <span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span>\n<h2 id=\"jump-link-where-and-how-will-you-use-your-charger\">Where and how will you use your charger?</h2> \n<figure>\n <img src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-02/c9a24a20-b7a0-11ed-b3cd-16d5d607f8d1\" data-uuid=\"5b99f136-c81a-38f1-8f9a-1e8f41fca499\">\n <figcaption></figcaption>\n</figure> \n<p>Odds are that you have a specific use case in mind for your charger. You may want it by your bedside on your nightstand for a quick charge in the morning, or on your desk for at-a-glance notifications. You might even keep it in your bag for convenient travel charging instead of bulky portable chargers or power banks. Think about where you want to use this accessory and what you want to do with the device(s) it charges while it’s powering up. For example, a wireless charging pad might be better for bedside use if you just want to be able to drop your phone down at the end of a long day and know it’ll be powered up in the morning. However, a stand will be better if you have an iPhone and want to make use of the Standby feature during the nighttime hours.</p> \n<p>For a desk wireless charger, a stand lets you more easily glance at phone notifications throughout the day. For traveling, undoubtedly, a puck-style charging pad is best since it will take up much less space in your bag than a stand would. Many power banks also include wireless charging pads built in, so one of those might make even more sense for those who are always on the go. Some foldable chargers are also designed for travel, collapsing flat to take up less space.</p> \n<h2 id=\"jump-link-wireless-charging-performance\">Wireless charging performance</h2> \n<p>Although wireless charging is usually slower than its wired equivalent, speed and wattage are still important considerations. A fast charger can supply enough power for a long night out in the time it takes to change outfits. Look for options that promise faster charging and support standards like Qi2 certified charging for the best balance of efficiency and compatibility.</p> \n<p>In general, a 15W charger is more than quick enough for most situations, and you’ll need a MagSafe-compatible charger to extract that level of performance from an iPhone. With that said, even the slower 7.5W and 10W chargers are fast enough for an overnight power-up. If anything, you’ll want to worry more about support for cases. While many models can deliver power through a reasonably thick case (typically 3mm to 5mm), you’ll occasionally run into examples that only work with naked phones.</p> \n<p>There are some proprietary chargers that smash the 15W barrier if you have the right phone.

Some wireless chargers don’t include power adapters, and others may even ask you to reuse your phone’s USB-C charging cable. What may seem to be a bargain may prove expensive if you have to buy extras just to use it properly. As mentioned above, you’ll want to make sure all of the components needed to use the wireless charger can provide the level of power you need — you’re only as strong (or in this case, fast) as your weakest link.</p> \n<p>Fit and finish is also worth considering. You’re likely going to use your wireless charger every day, so even small differences in build quality could make the difference between joy and frustration. If your charger doesn’t use MagSafe-compatible tech, textured surfaces like fabric or rubberized plastic are more likely to keep your phone in place. The base should be grippy or weighty enough that the charger won’t slide around. Also double check that the wireless charger you’re considering can support phones outfitted with cases — the specifications are usually listed in the charger’s description or specs.</p> \n<p>You’ll also want to think about the minor conveniences. Status lights are useful for indicating correct phone placement, but an overly bright light can be distracting. Ideally, the light dims or shuts off after a certain period of time. And while we caution against lips and trays that limit compatibility, you may still want some barriers to prevent your device falling off its perch on the charging station.</p> \n<h2 id=\"jump-link-wireless-chargers-faqs\">Wireless chargers FAQs</h2> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-do-wireless-chargers-work-if-you-have-a-phone-case\">Do wireless chargers work if you have a phone case?</h3> \n<p>Many wireless chargers do work if you leave the case on your phone. Generally, a case up to 3mm thick should be compatible with most wireless chargers. However, you should check the manufacturer’s guide to ensure a case is supported.</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-how-do-i-know-if-my-phone-supports-wireless-charging\">How do I know if my phone supports wireless charging?</h3> \n<p>Checking the phone’s specification should tell you if your phone is compatible with wireless charging. You might see words like “Qi wireless charging” or “wireless charging compatible.”</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-do-cords-charge-your-phone-faster\">Do cords charge your phone faster?</h3> \n<p>Most often, wired charging will be faster than wireless charging. However, wired charging also depends on what the charging cable’s speed is and how much power it’s designed to carry. A quick-charging cable that can transmit up to 120W of power is going to be faster than a wireless charger.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/computing/accessories/best-wireless-charger-140036359.html?src=rss",

Instead of offering the handheld for $209 until January, Retroid removed the discount in late December, leaving new buyers paying the full retail price of $229. However, the internal specs remained the same, with a Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 processor, up to 12GB of memory and up to 256GB of storage that&#39;s expandable with a TF card slot.</p>\n<p>Despite the hiccups, Retroid looks ready to start shipments of its latest retro gaming handheld as evidenced by the new photos and videos.

And with some incredible new releases this year, we were really eatin’ good. Here are some of the Engadget team’s favorite things we listened to in 2025.</p><h2 id=\"aff7f80e-bda8-4cf9-8dfb-79488507995c\">Spiritbox - <em>Tsunami Sea</em></h2><p>I became aware of Spiritbox in late 2024 shortly before the band dropped its latest album, <em>Tsunami Sea. </em>At the time, I was in a deep Sleep Token phase, and I don’t remember how I stumbled upon Spiritbox, but I’m sure glad I did. Not knowing anything about the band, I initially thought it had two singers: one for clean vocals and another for the harsh, guttural screams.&nbsp;</p><p>Well, I was wrong. Vocalist Courtney LaPlante handles it all, and she is a force of nature. After learning of a new band, I do what any self-respecting music nerd does: I looked up live videos of them on YouTube. The way LaPlante seamlessly transitions from airy, ambient singing to some of the best growls you’ll hear in metal music is effortless. And after seeing Spiritbox live in person earlier in December, I can attest to her ability to consistently nail both vocal styles for the entirety of an hour-long set.&nbsp;</p><p>My infatuation with Spiritbox isn’t just with the vocalist though. Guitarist Mike Stringer, LaPlante’s husband, also has a lot of unique abilities to offer. Stringer’s use of noise and whammy effects in his riffs create a signature style, not to mention his mix of nu-metal, djent and metalcore sensibilities. He also has some of the thickest guitar tones I’ve ever heard live, and I was mesmerized for the full set. Stringer’s guitar work on <em>Tsunami Sea </em>is a prime example of a&nbsp; unique musician at the height of his powers.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Tsunami Sea </em>takes you on a ride. The first two tracks are all-out ragers, and after a slight respite in “Perfect Soul” and “Keep Sweet,” the album’s best song comes fifth. I’ve heard LaPlante dedicate it to “all the people I love to fucking hate,” and it’s clearly written about her enemies. It’s also the perfect example of what this band is capable of. It’s three minutes of LaPlante’s screams interlaced with plenty of Stringer’s trademark guitar work.&nbsp;</p><div><div style=\"left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;\"><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/80VTmBAnTSE?rel=0\" style=\"top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;\" allowfullscreen scrolling=\"no\" data-provider-name=\"youtube\"></iframe></div></div><p>The rest of the album showcases the band’s ability to blend dynamics, with “No Loss, No Love” and “Ride The Wave” providing the highlights on the back half of the record. The album’s title track is a great vehicle for LaPlante’s clean vocals, serving as the introduction to the album’s second act. If you’ve been enamored with Sleep Token this year like I have, give Spiritbox a go — you won’t be sorry you did. — <em>Billy Steele, Deputy Editor, Reviews</em></p><h2 id=\"914d02d0-400b-4c27-8572-6eb6ab5033d6\"><em>Bandsplain</em></h2><p>I didn’t discover <em>Bandsplain </em>in 2025, but I definitely listened to it more than any other podcast in terms of total time spent. Sure, that’s because most episodes are over three hours long, but I digress. Host Yasi Salek does a deep dive on “cult bands and iconic artists” to… ahem, bandsplain why people love them. There’s a deep catalog of back episodes, so there’s sure to be an in-depth analysis of a band you’re familiar with. But even if you think you know an artist, I’m willing to bet Salek will divulge parts of the story you weren’t aware of.&nbsp;</p><p>Jimmy Eat World’s <em>Clarity </em>is a top 5 all-timer for me, and Salek had plenty to offer about the narrative around that album I didn’t know. Her grunge series from 2024 was a history lesson I wish I’d had in middle school when I first discovered Soundgarden, Pearl Jam, Alice in Chains and the rest of the lot. An older episode about Nine Inch Nails served as the primer for me seeing the band live for the first time in September. And that’s the thing about the show: the back catalog holds up. If you’re waiting for the next installment to drop, there’s certainly something in the archives you’ll enjoy.&nbsp;</p><p>No shade to Salek’s colleagues at <em>The Ringer, </em>but the best episodes of <em>Bandsplain </em>are when the guest is a musician. Thursday front man Geoff Rickly was excellent on that Nine Inch Nails episode, and Death Cab for Cutie singer Ben Gibbard had me on the edge of my seat when he was on to discuss The La’s — a band I’d never heard of before. I’d also highly recommend the episodes on Oasis and the more recent one on Alanis Morissette. But, really, you can’t go wrong starting from anywhere on the episode list. <em>— B.S.</em></p><h2 id=\"348e4012-5e93-4889-b389-38394040908a\">Lucy Dacus - <em>Forever is a Feeling</em>&nbsp;</h2><div><div style=\"left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;\"><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/6kRRvhAVZ84?rel=0\" style=\"top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;\" allowfullscreen scrolling=\"no\" data-provider-name=\"youtube\"></iframe></div></div><p>I remember being a teenager and hearing from an adult that they did not religiously seek out, research, evaluate and introduce new bands and songs into their lives as if all existence would cease without the life-sustaining energy of new music. I was confused, concerned and damn sure that wouldn’t happen to me.&nbsp;</p><p>You know where this story goes: Job. Kid. House. Spouse. Pets that will die if I don’t feed, walk, play with and/or medicate them. I allow the algorithm to feed me new songs but rarely does something stick, so I end up listening to tracks I bonded with in my teens and twenties.&nbsp;</p><p>This year, <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"link rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=8662230b-20ea-4e5c-af78-eeacc5a14a34&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=6dcacbf8-c8f4-4944-b5c8-3117aa1edf32&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Instagram&amp;linkText=Blossom+%26+Bones&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5pbnN0YWdyYW0uY29tL2dob3N0cmFuY2htdXNpY2Zlc3RpdmFsLyIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiNmRjYWNiZjgtYzhmNC00OTQ0LWI1YzgtMzExN2FhMWVkZjMyIiwib3JpZ2luYWxVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5pbnN0YWdyYW0uY29tL2dob3N0cmFuY2htdXNpY2Zlc3RpdmFsLyJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAcONAodm2UFPcfTTiIwK541CZC8aehAz0FvMJy73RPFM&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.instagram.com%2Fghostranchmusicfestival%2F\" data-i13n=\"elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Instagram;elmt:;cpos:2;pos:1\" data-original-link=\"https://www.instagram.com/ghostranchmusicfestival/\">Blossom &amp; Bones</a>, a three-day music festival in Ghost Ranch, New Mexico, managed to push through the churn and lodge new music into my brain. Along with my kid and some friends, I camped among some of the most beautiful landscapes imaginable and ambled over to the stage each evening for performances by Santigold, Ani DiFranco and about a dozen more.&nbsp;</p><p>Lucy Dacus, one third of the indie group Boygenius, did a one-hour set with plenty of songs from her latest album <em>Forever is a Feeling</em>. Hearing the songs for the first time, I felt like I’d been listening to them for years. Lilting harmonies and layered strings create a lovely backdrop for Dacus’s velvet voice, but there’s a sharpness to her observations about relationships, rejection and sex. I’ve been looping the album ever since. — <em>Amy Skorheim, Senior Reporter, Buying Advice</em></p><h2 id=\"357a8d1c-06b2-49ae-899f-9822adf82782\">Blanco White - “So Certain” (single)</h2><div><div style=\"left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;\"><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/8skj1w1XdFc?rel=0\" style=\"top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;\" allowfullscreen scrolling=\"no\" data-provider-name=\"youtube\"></iframe></div></div><p>Early on the last concert of the day at that same festival, Blanco White took the stage. People were aimlessly milling about and the sun hadn’t yet set. Kids were playing on the lawn and the smell from the food trucks was intense, but I was enrapt by the four people on stage. The sad violin and strummy guitars floated with the hand-beat drum out into the red hills. The music sounded like I felt: rooted and wrapped in the harsh beauty of the desert and I was really glad to take that home with me. <em>— A.S.</em></p><h2 id=\"75068a5c-9263-40b8-bf74-fdd93ea57a88\"><em>Martian Revolution&nbsp;</em></h2><p>If you&#39;re as big a nerd as I am, you might know that Leo Tolstoy didn&#39;t consider <em>War and Peace </em>to be a novel. The story is what most people read for, but in the author&#39;s mind, all the drama was a parable to illustrate his grand theory of history.</p><p>Over the last year, history podcaster Mike Duncan has accomplished a similar feat using a medium Tolstoy never imagined. Duncan&#39;s <em>Revolutions </em>podcast has covered ten different revolutionary upheavals across history, starting with the English Civil War and ending with the Russian Revolution. After wrapping up the Bolsheviks, Duncan took a few episodes to suggest a grand theory of how revolutions unfold. For a while, it seemed like that was all we&#39;d get. Then, in the middle of 2024, he started posting original sci-fi — without any indication that this tale, which followed future Martians revolting against their corporate overlords on Earth, was in any way different from the previous ten seasons.</p><p>Part of what makes the Martian Revolution so excellent is Duncan&#39;s deadpan delivery. He never once breaks character. He rattles off lists of fictional sources, apologizes for inaccuracies in prior episodes, and introduces made-up historical figures with the same gravity he once used to mention George Washington or Simon Bolivar. If you&#39;re a fan of <em>Revolutions, </em>you&#39;ll have a blast recognizing character archetypes. (Mabel Dore is the Liberal Noble! Timothy Werner is the Man of Blood!)</p><p>But the podcast is great even if you&#39;ve never listened to an episode of <em>Revolutions. </em>It has an excellent grasp of character and a sense of inevitable tragedy, but with moments of joy leavened throughout. I certainly hope we don&#39;t wind up in the megacorp-ruled future of the podcast, but if we do, it&#39;ll be a great consolation if it eventually turns out the way Duncan imagines.<em> — Sam Chapman, Senior Writer</em></p><h2 id=\"d1b2cc8f-a744-49b9-97f1-0e132570b47a\">Ron Gallo - <em>Checkmate</em>&nbsp;</h2><div><div style=\"left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;\"><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/MUc44nDVkNk?rel=0\" style=\"top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;\" allowfullscreen scrolling=\"no\" data-provider-name=\"youtube\"></iframe></div></div><p>My favorite artists are ones that surprise me, and Ron Gallo is a master of reinvention. He&#39;s dabbled in absurdist punk, psychedelia, garage rock, Beatles-tinged pop and, now, stripped-down acoustic music. This is not a genre I am typically a fan of, Elliott Smith withstanding, but <em>Checkmate</em> is something special. His lyrical prowess is off the charts here, trading his usual wordplay for simple and emotionally-gutting truisms about life, love and, well, the end of the world.&nbsp;</p><p>Of course, the lyrics wouldn&#39;t work if the songs weren&#39;t good. The songs are very good. The title track is just about the perfect love song, with a primary hook that gets lost in your head for weeks. Other tracks offer hints of Mac DeMarco, Dan Fogelberg, Kevin Morby and just about everyone else who has crafted great songs on an acoustic guitar. It&#39;s fitting that Gallo has found a home on the label Kill Rock Stars, which released so much of Elliott Smith&#39;s work back in the day. As an aside, Gallo regularly posts songs about current events on TikTok and other social media platforms, which are worth checking out if you like stuff like Jesse Welles. <em>— Lawrence Bonk, Contributing Reporter</em></p><h2 id=\"045e5129-981d-4dec-bee9-43aa358ff3b1\">De La Soul -<em> Cabin in the Sky</em></h2><div><div style=\"left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;\"><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/TQWm1hfju3Q?rel=0\" style=\"top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;\" allowfullscreen scrolling=\"no\" data-provider-name=\"youtube\"></iframe></div></div><p>There have been hip-hop albums that explored the finality and tragedy of death, but not many that truly tackled spirituality and long-term grief. De La Soul has done just that, following the passing of founding member Trugoy the Dove. This album serves as a final testament of sorts for Trugoy, as he&#39;s heavily featured throughout. In that way, <em>Cabin in the Sky</em> is reminiscent of A Tribe Called Quest&#39;s 2016 masterpiece <em>We Got It from Here... Thank You 4 Your Service</em>, which followed the death of rapper Phife Dawg.&nbsp;</p><p>Like Tribe&#39;s modern classic, <em>Cabin in the Sky</em> is filled with absolute bangers. It features standout beats by DJ Premier, Pete Rock, Trugoy, Jake One and others. The rhymes are great and all three primary De La members are given time to shine. Guest rappers like Common and Nas got the memo, delivering some of their most memorable verses in years. Heck, even Giancarlo Esposito is on board as the narrator. Some reviewers have dinged this album for being too long but, come on, that&#39;s like complaining there&#39;s too much pizza. It&#39;s De La Soul. <em>— L.B.</em></p><h2 id=\"a717515e-90c3-4e2f-9d84-9de305a72856\">FKA twigs - <em>Eusexua</em></h2><div><div style=\"left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;\"><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/KnGSVIZGkQo?rel=0\" style=\"top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;\" allowfullscreen scrolling=\"no\" data-provider-name=\"youtube\"></iframe></div></div><p>This was a really good year for new music IMO, so much that I&#39;ve been finding it pretty difficult to think back and settle on my favorite releases. But, FKA twigs&#39; <em>Eusexua</em> undeniably did some heavy lifting for me, pretty much carrying me through the first six or so months of the year without much competition, and I&#39;ve circled right back to it as the year closes. It&#39;s an album that somehow seems to meet every vibe. It&#39;ll have you in club mode and ready for a night of sweaty, filthy dancing in under three minutes, or feeling bright and upbeat like a midday walk on the first day of spring — yet it still hits when you&#39;re having a good ol&#39; car cry.&nbsp;</p><p>&quot;Girl Feels Good&quot; is for sure one of my most-played songs of the year, followed closely by &quot;Eusexua,&quot; &quot;Perfect Stranger,&quot; &quot;Keep It, Hold It&quot; and &quot;Striptease.&quot; If ever I can&#39;t decide what I&#39;m in the mood to listen to, I throw this album on and it doesn&#39;t disappoint.<em> — Cheyenne MacDonald, Weekend Editor</em></p><h2 id=\"121a7e44-5a35-427e-8ab3-8861f5b4f8e9\">Faetooth - <em>Labyrinthine</em>&nbsp;</h2><div><div style=\"left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;\"><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/q6prtDY9fQQ?rel=0\" style=\"top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;\" allowfullscreen scrolling=\"no\" data-provider-name=\"youtube\"></iframe></div></div><p>Faetooth&#39;s sophomore album, <em>Labyrinthine</em>, is face-melting, melancholic perfection. The band describes its sound as &quot;fairy doom,&quot; but don&#39;t let that first word fool you into thinking it isn&#39;t heavy as hell. <em>Labyrinthine</em> goes unbelievably hard, and will have you feeling like you&#39;re eternally wandering a cursed bog, surrounded by the wailing of the unfortunate souls who came before you. Don&#39;t believe me? Put on &quot;White Noise.&quot; This is really an album that should be enjoyed in its entirety, though, and I can&#39;t individually name half the songs on it because I tend to just keep the whole thing playing on rotation. <em>— C.M.&nbsp;</em></p><h2 id=\"50e847e0-53c8-4c3e-8d0b-af387419732d\">Orville Peck - <em>Appaloosa</em>&nbsp;</h2><div><div style=\"left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;\"><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/-Q0wlv9CRKw?rel=0\" style=\"top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;\" allowfullscreen scrolling=\"no\" data-provider-name=\"youtube\"></iframe></div></div><p>This EP is truly a testament to my ability to run my obsessions into the ground, because it only came out in mid-November and somehow landed on my most-listened wrapup for the end of the year… which was released some two weeks later. It&#39;s front-loaded with its strongest songs, a powerful and kind of haunting trio that just flows beautifully from one into the other: &quot;Dreaded Sundown,&quot; to &quot;Drift Away&quot; into &quot;Atchafalaya&quot; (ft. Noah Cyrus). As a fan of musicals, I also loved the inclusion of &quot;Maybe This Time,&quot; a cover from <em>Cabaret</em>, especially since I was pretty bummed to have missed Peck&#39;s stint as the Emcee in <em>Cabaret</em> on Broadway this summer. <em>— C.M.</em></p><h2 id=\"f81e58b3-82cd-4f8f-8669-362bf94f0357\"><em>Case 63&nbsp;</em></h2><p>I got into an audio series kick this year, and dove into shows like <em>Unicorn Girl</em>, <em>Stalked!</em> and more. But none of the dramatized fiction I listened to in 2025 had me hooked like <em>Case 63</em>. Setting aside that it’s voice-acted by A-listers Julianne Moore and Oscar Isaac, which is a phenomenal pairing that won me over on star power alone. The best thing about <em>Case 63</em> is its storytelling.&nbsp;</p><p>Moore stars as a psychologist, meeting Isaac for the first time in a prison interview. Isaac has been claiming to be a traveler of sorts, and through recorded sessions and voice notes, we hear his side of the story, as well as her reactions and ultimate involvement in the adventures. Every step of the way, particularly in the beginning, there is clear explanation as to why the exchange is being recorded. It isn’t necessary, but it’s helpful in my buying into the realism of the story.&nbsp;</p><p>It isn’t just the method and technical aspects of the storytelling, of course. Narratively, <em>Case 63</em> is a gripping ride, and thanks to its short episodes, it’s easy to binge really quickly. There is certainly a generous use of cliffhangers to help speed things along, but I found myself eager to devour the entire series in one commute. The story continued to linger in my mind days after I finished both existing seasons, and I’m hoping the new one drops soon. If you’re looking for a quick and easy sci-fi audio series, do not miss <em>Case 63</em>. —<em> Cherlynn Low, Managing Editor</em></p><h2 id=\"64a4d5af-a325-4bf8-92e0-ec7d8cfac840\"><em>Secure Love&nbsp;</em></h2><p>I spent a lot of time this year trying to learn more about my attachment style and how it shows up in all the relationships in my life. Between Stephanie Rigg’s <em>On Attachment</em> podcast, the TV show <em>Couples Therapy</em> and all the books on the topic of attachment styles, trauma and more, I’ve consumed them all. And while they’ve all been helpful in different ways, one podcast stuck out to me this year. It’s hosted by Julie Menanno, MA, LMFT, LCPC, creator of the <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"link rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=8662230b-20ea-4e5c-af78-eeacc5a14a34&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=6dcacbf8-c8f4-4944-b5c8-3117aa1edf32&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Instagram&amp;linkText=%40TheSecureRelationship&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5pbnN0YWdyYW0uY29tL3RoZXNlY3VyZXJlbGF0aW9uc2hpcC8iLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjZkY2FjYmY4LWM4ZjQtNDk0NC1iNWM4LTMxMTdhYTFlZGYzMiIsIm9yaWdpbmFsVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuaW5zdGFncmFtLmNvbS90aGVzZWN1cmVyZWxhdGlvbnNoaXAvIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAaevBNsYgk_rLmPM5tqcXE7ThzNWozvwhS8t6tIFTIhF&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.instagram.com%2Fthesecurerelationship%2F\" data-i13n=\"elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Instagram;elmt:;cpos:3;pos:1\" data-original-link=\"https://www.instagram.com/thesecurerelationship/\">@TheSecureRelationship</a> account on Instagram and the author of <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"link rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;itemId=amazon_1668012863&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=6dcacbf8-c8f4-4944-b5c8-3117aa1edf32&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;linkText=Secure+Love%3A+Create+a+relationship+that+lasts+a+lifetime&amp;custData=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&amp;signature=AQAAAbCQbf932ToPk1w2G5ARGlPo4C2APtqGjwwBO9Uc7pek&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FSecure-Love-Create-Relationship-Lifetime%2Fdp%2F1668012863\" data-i13n=\"elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:;cpos:4;pos:1\" data-original-link=\"https://www.amazon.com/Secure-Love-Create-Relationship-Lifetime/dp/1668012863\"><em>Secure Love: Create a relationship that lasts a lifetime</em></a>.&nbsp;</p><p>You can probably tell from that introduction what Menanno’s work is all about.

Each season of the podcast (it’s partway through the second as of this writing) sees Menanno work with one couple through their negative cycles, using somatic practices to help each partner understand their emotions, triggers and reactions. Because we’re listening to real people talk about real-life happenings, it’s not only easy to relate, but listeners often see themselves in these scenarios. At the start of each episode, too, Menanno reads out or plays notes from the audience, and you can see how fellow listeners have reacted.&nbsp;</p><p>This season, for example, my friend and some other listeners seemed to really dislike Brian, the anxious male partner in this season’s pair. While I’ve certainly found some of Brian’s ways of speaking borderline offensive, I had a lot more sympathy for him as I started seeing his traits in my loved ones. I also started to identify with his partner Bethany, who Menanno typed as having an avoidant attachment style.&nbsp;</p><p>As I listened to Bethany and Brian describe the reasons they got into fights and explain where they were coming from, suddenly it felt like the world made sense. I saw similar patterns and reasonings in my own relationship, as well as those of my parents, relatives and friends.&nbsp;</p><p>It is slightly voyeuristic to listen to something so intimate, of course, but Menanno makes it all educational rather than just entertaining. She gently interrupts parts of each episode to tell the audience why she asks certain questions or what she’s attempting to achieve by asking Brian or Bethany to sit with their difficult feelings.&nbsp;</p><p>I found her method familiar, as I recently started working with a somatic coach whose approach is similar to Menanno’s, which is rooted in emotion-focused therapy (EFT). Staying with uncomfortable feelings makes me want to jump out of my skin, but being able to endure them, question why they arise and then understand where they come from is crucial to helping uncover the thinking that causes them. Sometimes they’re the result of flawed logic, catastrophic thinking or a simple lack of context, but often they’re very reasonable reactions.&nbsp;</p><p>If you’re looking to understand yourself and your emotions a bit better, or just want to get an idea of what EFT or couples therapy sounds like, I can’t recommend <em>The Secure Love Podcast</em> highly enough. <em>— C.L.</em></p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/music/what-we-listened-to-in-2025-201308584.html?src=rss",

Whether it&#39;s a slim folio case, an Apple Pencil, a docking station or a paper-like screen protector, there are so many iPad accessories out there that can transform how you use your tablet on a regular basis — and make your iPad last longer, too.

There are a couple of ways to do this: first, you can check the back of your tablet for its model number, which will start with an “A” and end with a series of numbers. You can also go into Settings on your iPad, then General and look up the model number in the top section. If you see a series of letters and numbers with a slash (“/“) in it, just tap that to reveal the iPad’s true model number.</p> <span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span>\n<p>The most important iPad details to consider before buying accessories are the charging port, screen size and Apple Pencil compatibility. Most iPads now have USB-C charging, save for the now discontinued 9th-gen iPad that still requires a Lightning cable.

They pull double-duty: Not only do they act as a first line of defense if your iPad goes careening onto concrete, but they can also enhance the digital drawing and writing experience. Using a stylus on an iPad is strange at first because gliding the stylus nib over a glass surface feels nothing like “normal” writing. Matte screen protectors can get closer to replicating the pen-on-paper experience, and they also prevent the stylus nib from wearing down as quickly.</p> \n<p>\n <core-commerce id=\"096ee51d507446e58275b58455543392\" data-type=\"product-list\" data-original-url=\"https://www.amazon.com/PaperLike-Pieces-iPad-2020-10-9/dp/B0BJKQ4T6B?ref_=ast_sto_dp&amp;th=1&amp;psc=1\"></core-commerce></p> \n<p>\n <core-commerce id=\"13f27d1d0d444247a1da1671b1c13aff\" data-type=\"product-list\" data-original-url=\"https://www.amazon.com/BELLEMOND-SET-Protector-compatible-WIPD129PLK/dp/B08JFXGMD7?th=1\"></core-commerce></p> \n<p>\n <core-commerce id=\"8b17ec92ec5e413a85bd60479a04b134\" data-type=\"product-list\" data-original-url=\"https://pen.tips/collections/products/products/penmat?variant=43000769544439\"></core-commerce></p> \n<p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/computing/accessories/best-ipad-accessories-130018595.html?src=rss",

There&#39;s a 39-inch OLED (39GX950B) that includes the aforementioned AI upscaling to 5K, but also algorithms for scene optimization and sound. The company says this will &quot;refine images and audio performance for a more immersive audiovisual experience.&quot;</p>\n<p>This monitor can easily switch from the standard resolution with a refresh rate of 165Hz to a much zippier WFHD resolution with a refresh rate of 330Hz. This is supported by a 0.03ms response time.

This display has been &quot;designed to dramatically improve blooming control&quot;, which is done by minimizing halo effects and stuffing in 2,304 local dimming zones. LG promises it &quot;preserves fine details across bright and dark scenes alike.&quot;</p>\n<p>This one features AI algorithms for upscaling to 5K, scene optimization and sound. It can also switch between 165Hz at 5K and 330Hz at QHD, with a 1ms response time. The screen boasts a peak brightness of 1,250 nits.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-12/03ac5070-e279-11f0-bdd6-6003f9c9164c\" data-crop-orig-src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-12/03ac5070-e279-11f0-bdd6-6003f9c9164c\" style=\"height:1226px;width:2200px;\" alt=\"A display.\" data-uuid=\"956ff9d8-04b6-348a-93c3-2f089ed869a4\"><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">LG</div></figure>\n<p>Finally, there&#39;s the beastly 52-inch (52G930B) large-format gaming display.

The 1000R curvature wraps around the peripheral, which should be great for flying sims and stuff like that.</p>\n<p>LG hasn&#39;t released any information as to when we&#39;ll be able to get our mitts on these displays, or how much they will cost.
