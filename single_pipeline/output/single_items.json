The app has also reached the top five in the UK and Australian app stores. In the United States, its sudden popularity seems to be closely tied to recent changes at TikTok.&nbsp;</p><p>UpScrolled has seen 41,000 total downloads between Thursday (the day the US joint venture was formalized) and Saturday, according to estimates from App Figures. The app, which was first released last June, has been downloaded about 140,000 times between Apple and Google's app stores, according to App Figures. Prior to last Thursday, the app was averaging less than 500 downloads a day, according to the company. The rapid increase in downloads has apparently caused some issues for the company which asked users to \"bear with us\" on Monday.</p><div><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Well, this is new...<br>You showed up so fast our servers tapped out.

And that's what UpScrolled seems to be betting on. \"Too often, users are left uncertain about whether their voices will be heard or quietly suppressed,\" the company writes on its website. \"UpScrolled changes that by ensuring every post has a fair chance to be seen, creating an environment that is authentic, unfiltered, and equitable for all.\"</p><p><strong>Update, January 26, 2026, 4:28PM PT: </strong>This post was updated to reflect the latest details from TikTok about the ongoing issues affecting the US version of the app.</p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/social-media/people-are-uninstalling-tiktok-and-downloading-an-indie-competitor-233345222.html?src=rss",

The more detail you can provide when describing what you want from it, the better the results. And remember: ChatGPT can hallucinate — as you may have noticed from one of the example pictures I included above. In the image of the tortoiseshell cat, not only is the tortie not sitting on the window sill as instructed, it's sitting on a table that doesn't make much sense. So, most of all, be patient. Prompting an AI model is not exact science, and it can take a few tries before it creates the result you want.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=\"jump-link-faqs\">FAQs</h2><h3 id=\"jump-link-how-do-you-access-chatgpt\">How do you access ChatGPT?</h3><p>ChatGPT is available on the web, desktop and mobile.

This is starting with the Department of Transportation, according to interviews with agency staffers. Regulations created by the DOT help keep us safe when traveling.</p>\n<p>The plan was initially presented to DOT staffers last month, with agency attorney Daniel Cohen writing to colleagues about AI&#39;s &quot;potential to revolutionize the way we draft rulemakings.&quot; Gregory Zerzan, the agency&#39;s general counsel, has indicated that President Donald Trump is &quot;very excited by this initiative&quot; and that DOT will be &quot;the first agency that is fully enabled to use AI to draft rules.&quot; This does suggest a pilot program of sorts, with eventual plans to bring AI to other departments.</p>\n<span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><div id=\"c7604dd648514ab68e0ce54091b1ded9\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">NEW: The Trump administration is planning to use AI to write federal regulations despite the risk of hallucinations.<br><br>“We don&#39;t even need a very good rule,” <a href=\"https://twitter.com/USDOT?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@USDOT</a>’s top lawyer said of the plan, per meeting notes reviewed by ProPublica. “We want good enough.” 🧵 <a href=\"https://t.co/YKGvmlkMCt\">pic.twitter.com/YKGvmlkMCt</a></p>— Jesse Coburn (@Jesse_Coburn) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Jesse_Coburn/status/2015764243728003411?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">January 26, 2026</a></blockquote>\n \n\n</div>\n<p>Oddly, Zerzan doesn&#39;t seem that interested in high-quality regulations. <em>ProPublica</em> received transcripts of a meeting in which he declared that &quot;we don&#39;t need the perfect rule on XYZ. We don&#39;t even need a very good rule on XYZ.&quot; He went on to say that &quot;we want good enough&quot; and that &quot;we&#39;re flooding the zone.&quot;</p>\n<p>Let me remind you that DOT regulates the safety standards of commercial aircraft, along with rules involving the transport of hazardous materials and driver qualifications. The agency&#39;s rules touch on every aspect of transportation safety.

Writing and revising complex federal regulations can take months, but Google Gemini can spit something out in minutes. A DOT employee giving a presentation on the program suggested that many parts of these regulations are just &quot;word salad&quot; anyways, so AI should be able to do just fine.</p>\n<p>&quot;It shouldn’t take you more than 20 minutes to get a draft rule out of Gemini,&quot; Zerzan said. The plan is to compress the timeline in which transportation regulations are written and reviewed. The department has already used AI to draft an unpublished Federal Aviation Administration rule.</p>\n<p>Federal agencies have used AI for years, but not to actually write regulations. It&#39;s primarily been used for the purpose of translating documents, analyzing data and categorizing public comments. Trump, however, is a huge <a data-i13n=\"cpos:3;pos:1\" href=\"https://www.ai.gov/\"><ins>proponent of the technology</ins></a>. He has released multiple executive orders <a data-i13n=\"cpos:4;pos:1\" href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/12/eliminating-state-law-obstruction-of-national-artificial-intelligence-policy/\"><ins>in support of AI</ins></a> and once shared an AI-created video in which <a data-i13n=\"cpos:5;pos:1\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/20/trump-ai-video-no-kings\"><ins>he flew a fighter jet</ins></a> and dropped what appears to be feces on American citizens.</p>\n<p>Skeptics say that large language models like Gemini shouldn&#39;t be in charge of drafting complicated and consequential regulations that impact millions of everyday Americans. Mistakes could lead to lawsuits and even injuries and deaths.</p>\n<p>Mike Horton, DOT’s former acting chief artificial intelligence officer, said using Gemini to draft regulations was like “having a high school intern that’s doing your rulemaking.” He also said that agency leaders under Trump &quot;want to go fast and break things, but going fast and breaking things means people are going to get hurt.&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;Just because these tools can produce a lot of words doesn’t mean that those words add up to a high-quality government decision,” said Bridget Dooling, a professor at Ohio State University who studies administrative law. “It’s so tempting to try to figure out how to use these tools, and I think it would make sense to try. But I think it should be done with a lot of skepticism.&quot;</p>\n<p>DOT has experienced a net loss of more than 4,000 employees since Trump started his second term.

After you beat a level’s boss, you can keep going as long as you can stay alive and really put your builds to the test. </p><p>The Regal Update brought two more playable hunters to the mix as well. Opt to use The Falconer, and you’ll fire balls from two birds, one at each side of the screen. When balls return to The Carouser, they orbit around him to deal extra damage. Sun added that this character “twists ball trajectories with a personal gravity field that pulls shots off their usual paths.”</p><p>Then there are the new balls. The Stone Ball is powerful, but disintegrates as it bounces. Two of the latest balls deal spins on fire damage and the Fireworks Ball seems like it’ll add even more chaotic visual flair. The update added a trio of passives too. I enjoy creating builds around baby balls (a secondary type of ball that doesn’t have a special ability), so I’m eager to try out Iron Onesie. This passive scales up the damage of special balls depending on how many baby balls are in play. </p><p>Finally, the update introduced support for more languages.

This year marks the fourth time Italy has hosted the Winter Games; most recently, Turin hosted in 2006. Of the 16 sports that will be featured at the Winter Olympics, there will be 15 returning favorites, including figure skating, Alpine skiing, curling, ice hockey, speedskating, snowboarding, freestyle skiing and ski jumping, and one entirely new sport, snow mountaineering. (Will it be as big a hit as the 2024 Summer Games&#39; new addition, <a data-i13n=\"cpos:2;pos:1\" href=\"https://sports.yahoo.com/olympic-breaking-live-updates-rules-124130700.html\">breaking</a>? It remains to be seen.)</p> \n<p>Live coverage of every event at the Olympic Winter Games Milano Cortina 2026 will be available to stream on Peacock — though thanks to the time difference between Italy and the U.S., to watch many of the events live, you&#39;ll have to wake up (or stay up) until 2AM or 3AM ET. Primetime replays and select live coverage will air on NBC. The games officially kick off with the opening ceremony on Feb. 6, 2026.</p> <span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span>\n<p>Here&#39;s what else you need to know about watching the 2026 Winter Olympics.</p> \n<h2 id=\"jump-link-how-to-watch-the-2026-winter-olympics\"><strong>How to watch the 2026 Winter Olympics</strong></h2> \n<p>\n <core-commerce id=\"f1d6ae1c96104bc2b1c7c632ae2525b9\" data-type=\"product-list\" data-original-url=\"https://www.peacocktv.com/\"></core-commerce></p> \n<p>\n <core-commerce id=\"52ac3e1a141a4cc18a11a4b628835d45\" data-type=\"product-list\" data-original-url=\"https://www.directv.com/stream/\"></core-commerce></p> \n<p><strong>Dates:</strong> Feb. 6 - Feb. 22</p> \n<p><strong>TV channel: </strong>NBC</p> \n<p><strong>Streaming:</strong> Peacock</p> \n<h2 id=\"jump-link-when-are-the-2026-winter-olympics\"><strong>When are the 2026 Winter Olympics?</strong></h2> \n<p>The Winter Olympics officially begin with the opening ceremony on Feb. 6, although some events will start as early as Feb. 4).

Just use the code <strong>NEWYEAR2026</strong> at checkout to get the discount.</p> \n<p>Monarch Money makes for a capable and detailed budgeting companion. You can use the service via apps for iOS, Android, iPadOS or the web, and Monarch also offers a Chrome extension that can sync your Amazon and Target transactions and automatically categorize them. Like other budgeting apps, Monarch Money lets you connect multiple financial accounts and track your money based on where you spend it over time. Monarch offers two different approaches to tracking budgeting (flexible and category budgeting) depending on what fits your life best, and the ability to add a budget widget on your phone so you can know how you&#39;re tracking that month.</p> <span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span>\n<p>\n <core-commerce id=\"78691f6e9a994323adf7b4c97f1ff66d\" data-type=\"product-list\" data-original-url=\"https://www.monarch.com/\"></core-commerce></p> \n<p>How budgeting apps turn your raw transactions into visuals you can understand at a glance is one of the big things that differentiates one app from another, and Monarch Money offers multiple graphs and charts to look at for things like spending, investments or categories of your choice based on how you&#39;ve labelled your expenses. The app can also monitor the spending of you and your partner all in one place, to make it easier to plan together.</p> \n<p>The main drawbacks Engadget found in testing Monarch Money were the app&#39;s learning curve, and the differences in features (and bugginess) between Monarch&#39;s web and mobile versions. Still, for 50 percent off, the Monarch Money is well worth experimenting with if you&#39;re trying to save money in 2026, especially if you want to do it collaboratively with a partner.</p> \n<p><em>Follow </em><a data-i13n=\"cpos:3;pos:1\" href=\"https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals\"><em>@EngadgetDeals</em></a><em> on X for the latest </em><a data-i13n=\"cpos:4;pos:1\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/deals/\"><em>tech deals</em></a><em> and </em><a data-i13n=\"cpos:5;pos:1\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/best-tech/\"><em>buying advice</em></a><em>.</em></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/apps/monarch-moneys-budgeting-app-is-50-percent-off-for-new-users-right-now-204507443.html?src=rss",

    "title": "Resident Evil Requiem gives series fans the best of both action and survival horror",
    "body": "<p>The ninth mainline Resident Evil is trying to split the difference between the series’ action-heavy entries and the stress-inducing hide-and-seek episodes. During a four-hour playthrough of some early parts of <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/gaming/resident-evil-requiem-feels-very-familiar-but-its-so-well-made-that-i-respect-the-hell-out-of-it-180022141.html\" data-i13n=\"cpos:1;pos:1\">Resident Evil Requiem</a>, I spent time with both of the two main characters, Grace and series mainstay Leon. They offer distinctly different playstyles, talents, strengths, and weaknesses. While it isn&#39;t an entirely new premise for the survival horror series (in the original, playing as Chris Redfield offered  more challenge than playing as Jill Valentine) it’s never been this pronounced.&nbsp;</p><div><div><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9HIc7GZLa0&nbsp;\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" sandbox=\"allow-same-origin allow-forms allow-scripts\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" data-embed-domain=\"youtube.com\" data-provider-name=\"youtube\"></iframe></div></div><p>I started playing as Leon, entering a medical facility he seemed to have been invited to. With a cavernous main hall, it feels like yet another iconic Resident Evil hub, immediately reminding me of Raccoon City&#39;s Police Precinct and even the original&#39;s cavernous manor. Wings to explore? Check. Suspiciously quiet and empty central area that will almost definitely get overrun by zombies at some point? Probably.</p><p>Both Grace and Leon’s parts can be played in either third- or first-person perspective, though Leon’s segments seem better suited to the third-person view, since there&#39;s just a lot more shooting. Grace&#39;s segments were <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/gaming/resident-evil-requiem-feels-very-familiar-but-its-so-well-made-that-i-respect-the-hell-out-of-it-180022141.html\" data-i13n=\"cpos:2;pos:1\">tense</a> and demanded my full attention, more akin to <em>Resident Evil 7</em>. During this early part of the game, there is a lot of hiding, plenty of ammo conservation and a lot more learning from dumb mistakes. The parts of the game I played with Leon reminded me more of <em>Resident Evil 4</em> (or 5 or 6 – but let’s gloss over those).</p><p>Once you take control of him, Leon is immediately attacked and has to fend off roughly 15 infected doctors, nurses and patients. It’s a significant tone shift from Grace skulking around the facility, hiding behind plants and sometimes just hoping for the best.&nbsp;</p><figure><img src=\"https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/requiem1_2.jpg\" data-crop-orig-src=\"https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/requiem1_2.jpg\" style=\"height:1416px;width:2560px;\" alt=\"Leon faces off against a chainsaw-wielding doctor zombie. Best cut that arm off.\" data-uuid=\"6155b962-8622-4065-8f4e-80a35cde62ec\"><figcaption>Leon faces off against a chainsaw-wielding doctor zombie. Best cut that arm off.</figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Capcom</div></figure><p>Leon, fortunately, arrives with several weapons, including a new melee option, a hatchet. Using this, he can make targeted attacks to lop off limbs and aim at the head to deliver more damage. At least on these basic zombies, I found relentless slashing more effective than more targeted efforts – I’m sure future enemies will demand more… nuanced approaches. A later enemy must be decapitated to kill it.&nbsp;</p><p>After a set number of swings, you will need to retreat and sharpen the blade, which adds to the jeopardy while not disrupting the chaos. The hatchet can even be used to parry attacks – if you get the timing down.&nbsp;</p><p>Leon even gets to wield a chainsaw during this initial encounter, but only after claiming it from one particularly industrious zombie that seemed to find it inside a hospital. It was crucial to both disarm this zombie and grab the chainsaw before another corpse could take a turn on it. However, just because the chainsaw gets dropped doesn’t mean it’s turned off. I suffered significant damage when I repeatedly rushed into the spinning power tool.&nbsp;</p><p>The zombies in <em>Requiem</em> are also a little more nuanced compared to previous games – if a zombie can have nuance. While nearly all of the zombies will attack you on sight, they can be distracted or delayed based on the person they were before they turned. For example, the chef zombie (a hardy, bigger zombie than the ones you’ve come across until that point) will only chase you around his kitchen. Step out into the corridor and he’ll leave you alone. Elsewhere, a zombie (attached to an IV, cute) has his eyes bandaged and will react aggressively to any noise. I used this to my advantage, hurling an empty bottle at another zombie who stood nearby. The IV zombie killed him immediately. Another time, a senior exec who’s been turned is firing an employee of his… by killing them, moaning “You’re fired” as he does so. This little vignette gave me enough time to dim the lights and hide when he left his office.&nbsp;</p><p>In <em>Requiem</em>, players are expected to exploit individual zombie behaviors to outmaneuver them. It’s also a welcome dose of humor to the survival horror series, reminding me a little of the camp moments in<em> Dead Rising</em>, another zombie-centric Capcom series.&nbsp;</p><p>Leon doesn’t have to strategize quite as much, arriving with a particularly powerful handgun, the Requiem, that he eventually passes over to Grace. This is capable of stopping pretty much (but not all) enemies you come across, although it initially comes with only a single bullet, so you really have to make it count.&nbsp;</p><p>During a set-piece battle against a towering, swollen former patient, I got to test <em>Requiem</em>’s action-horror controls under pressure. Leon finds a shotgun and has to flank (and outrun) his “hungry” attacker. The environment in the rafters of the building is designed so it’s easy to figure out where you need to go and how to stop the giant zombie from cornering you. Ammo, at least during this fight, was scattered around, which was a relief after struggling to find bullets during Grace’s segment.</p><p>Despite the lack of traditional weapons, Grace eventually finds a blood injector (and its companion blood analysis system). These turn into <em>Requiem’s </em>crafting system. Powered by literal buckets and puddles of blood (you have to draw up infected blood from certain parts of the environment and enemies), samples can be combined with scraps, herbs and more to create high-powered first-aid shots, injectable explosive blood, ammunition and a lot of other things. Analysing different blood types (and solving some light puzzles) adds further crafting options.&nbsp;</p><figure><img src=\"https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/requiem1_3.jpg\" data-crop-orig-src=\"https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/requiem1_3.jpg\" style=\"height:1413px;width:2560px;\" alt=\"Oh he&#39;s not going to help you.\" data-uuid=\"73237b74-4422-4a42-ac91-5fd373f3792c\"><figcaption>Oh he&#39;s not going to help you.</figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Capcom</div></figure><p>During the preview, the infected blood injector was exclusively for Grace’s use. It’ll be intriguing if only one character gets to benefit from the crafting system, although Capcom teased customizable weapons for Leon, which might better suit his playstyle. Grace might also be handicapped by the typewriter save system popularized in the first few RE games. This could mean you’ll only be able to save if you have an ink ribbon on you, a very stressful part of inventory management early on in the series — she really can’t catch a break. However, it appears to be adjustable in difficulty settings.&nbsp;</p><p>According to Capcom’s  Resident Evil showcase last week, infected blood will apparently play a strong role in <em>Requiem</em>, touching on both Leon’s past (he’s apparently suffering from a mystery ailment) and the circumstances surrounding the death of Grace&#39;s mother. And it wouldn’t be a Resident Evil game with mystery, buckets of blood, and a pulpy villain. Capcom has primed another fascinating villain with <em>Requiem</em>’s Dr. Gideon, a former Umbrella virologist who was seemingly written for an actor to go <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2019-11-07-death-stranding-is-a-great-movie.html\" data-i13n=\"cpos:3;pos:1\">full camp baddie</a> – if the doctor’s hooded snakeskin trenchcoat wasn’t a giveaway.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Resident Evil Requiem will be released on February 27, 2026 for PC, PS5 and Xbox Series X|S.</em><br></p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/resident-evil-requiem-preview-150000849.html?src=rss",

Case in point: this new Disney+ deal. New and eligible returning subscribers can sign up for the <a data-i13n=\"elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Disney+;elmt:;cpos:2;pos:1\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=85d85ef3-fac9-418f-9573-418cf162cd0c&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=c4b6e8a2-981f-4fc9-b476-d49dcaeed4ba&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Disney%2B&amp;linkText=Disney%2B+Hulu+bundle&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5kaXNuZXlwbHVzLmNvbS8iLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6ImM0YjZlOGEyLTk4MWYtNGZjOS1iNDc2LWQ0OWRjYWVlZDRiYSIsIm9yaWdpbmFsVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZGlzbmV5cGx1cy5jb20vIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAYlgNIZqhCWI5a9GYTTCBjANZc2imSHnwOrLtdthLEQF&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.disneyplus.com%2F\" class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" data-original-link=\"https://www.disneyplus.com/\">Disney+ Hulu bundle</a> (with ads) for $10 for one month of access. That&#39;s $3 off the usual price of the bundle for one month, and more than 58 percent off if you consider the cost of each service individually (Disney+ at $12 per month and, separately, Hulu also at $12 per month).</p> \n<p>We&#39;d be remiss if we didn&#39;t mention that this isn&#39;t quite as good as the Black Friday deal we saw last year, which offered the same bundle for $5 per month for one year. However, if you missed that offer or just want to try out Disney+ and Hulu for a brief period of time, this is a good way to do so.</p> <span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span>\n<p>\n <core-commerce id=\"b28a2c9fc4054925875eb91d0c7e1cbe\" data-type=\"product-list\" data-original-url=\"https://www.disneyplus.com/\"></core-commerce></p> \n<p>Disney+ and Hulu make one of the most balanced streaming pairs available, blending family-friendly favorites with acclaimed originals and network TV staples. Disney+ brings a vast library of animated classics, blockbuster franchises and exclusive content from Marvel, Pixar, Star Wars and National Geographic. It’s the place to stream nearly every Star Wars film and series, plus the full Marvel Cinematic Universe lineup and Disney’s most recent theatrical releases.</p> \n<p>Hulu balances things out with a more adult-oriented lineup of current TV shows, next-day network episodes and a growing roster of award-winning originals. The platform hosts series like <em>The Bear,</em> <em>The Handmaid’s Tale</em> and <em>Only Murders in the Building</em>, alongside comedies, thrillers and documentaries that regularly feature in awards conversations. It’s also the home for next-day streaming of ABC and FX shows, making it especially useful if you’ve already cut the cable cord but still want to keep up with primetime TV.</p> \n<p>The Duo Basic bundle ties these two services together under a single subscription, offering a simple way to expand your library without juggling multiple accounts. This tier includes ads on both platforms, but the trade-off is significant savings compared with paying for each service separately. For many households, that’s an acceptable compromise when it means access to such a wide range of content.</p> \n<p><em>Follow </em><a data-i13n=\"cpos:3;pos:1\" href=\"https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals\"><em>@EngadgetDeals</em></a><em> on X for the latest </em><a data-i13n=\"cpos:4;pos:1\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/deals/\"><em>tech deals</em></a><em> and </em><a data-i13n=\"cpos:5;pos:1\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/best-tech/\"><em>buying advice</em></a><em>.</em></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/the-disney-hulu-bundle-is-down-to-10-for-one-month-right-now-192814643.html?src=rss",

    "title": "Outside Parties is the creepiest Playdate game yet, and I'm kind of obsessed",
    "body": "<p>Never underestimate the chilling powers of grainy grayscale imagery and ethereal whooshing sounds. <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"link\" href=\"https://play.date/games/outside-parties/\" data-i13n=\"cpos:1;pos:1\"><em>Outside Parties</em></a> asks, &quot;What if <em>I Spy</em>, but in an alien hell dimension?&quot;, and it is impressively unnerving despite the fact that nothing&#39;s really happening at any given time. It goes all in on atmosphere, to great effect. This is the Playdate horror game that I&#39;ve been waiting for.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Adams Immersive&#39;s <em>Outside Parties</em> is a sort of scavenger hunt across a massive image of a realm called the Outside, which can only be visited by astral travel, according to the lore. There are lots of unknowns about what or where it really is, though explorers have mapped it fairly extensively through out-of-body excursions and they&#39;ve encountered thousands of different entities there, including the spirits of the dead. As the player, you have come across a Hellscryer K5 — the communication device, psychic camera and recorder used for these trips — and now you&#39;re combing through the mission logs, getting sucked into the mystery of it all. Think of the K5 as your Playdate, except powered by blood and runes.</p>\n<p>At the center of <em>Outside Parties</em> is a 1.44 gigapixel, 360-degree panoramic HDR image which has dozens of eerie scenes hidden within it: skeletons of human, animal and paranormal origin; scary robed figures and occult symbols etched all around; what appear to be fountains and rivers of blood; a Stonehenge of teeth. These are the targets you&#39;re meant to track down, and as you hone in and check them off your list, voice signals attached to each one will reveal more and more of the explorer&#39;s spellbinding story.&nbsp;</p>\n<div>\n <div style=\"left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;\">\n  <iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/xoV-zXigJtg?rel=0\" style=\"top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;\" allowfullscreen scrolling=\"no\" data-embed-domain=\"youtube.com\" data-provider-name=\"youtube\"></iframe>\n </div>\n</div>\n<p>But this isn&#39;t a straightforward &quot;find the object&quot; puzzle game by any means. When you first look at the zoomed-out photo, it&#39;s akin to a strip of TV static with some heavily shadowed areas throughout. You can zoom to up to 64 times magnification to get a better look at specific zones, but you also have to adjust the image brightness using the crank to improve the clarity of the objects. Making it brighter or darker will reveal more objects in certain spots while simultaneously obscuring others. There are 150 targets according to the developer, which should take players somewhere from 10-20 hours to complete. I&#39;ve been at it for hours and still have plenty left to find. (If you&#39;re stuck, you can turn to the helpful <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"link\" href=\"https://adamsimmersive.com/apps/outside-parties/\" data-i13n=\"cpos:2;pos:1\">target lookup</a> page, which provides hints with varying degrees of specificity.)&nbsp;</p>\n<p>All the while as you&#39;re hunched over your Playdate, laser-focused on the screen to find targets that are buried in a sea of fuzz, unsettling audio transmissions are cutting in and out, disturbing images are flashing on-screen at random and a constant atmospheric whooshing is playing in your ear. The sound design of this game is seriously brilliant — it&#39;s worth playing for that alone, not to mention all the other cool stuff. From the startup page to the menus where you&#39;ll find bits of a background story, to the creepy clips of people wailing and ominously reciting numbers, the sounds of <em>Outside Parties</em> make for a truly immersive, disconcerting experience that I previously wouldn&#39;t have thought possible on a Playdate. It&#39;s really something special.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><em>Outside Parties</em> also comes with a screensaver that once again makes me yearn for the <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/gaming/panic-hits-pause-on-the-playdate-stereo-dock-says-its-unlikely-well-see-it-anytime-soon-191607744.html\" data-i13n=\"cpos:3;pos:1\">Playdate Stereo Dock</a>. Pop on the Void Monitor, sit back, and enjoy the horrifying sights and sounds of the Outside.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n <core-commerce data-type=\"product-list\" id=\"cb3ca1d1-d4c4-423c-bcb9-fd7d9c544abc\" data-original-url=\"https://play.date/games/outside-parties/\"></core-commerce></p>\n<p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/outside-parties-is-the-creepiest-playdate-game-yet-and-im-kind-of-obsessed-213142541.html?src=rss",

    "title": "How to use Workout Buddy with Apple Watch and iOS 26",
    "body": "<p>Apple’s iOS 26 and watchOS 26 introduced a new fitness companion called Workout Buddy. This feature uses Apple Intelligence to provide spoken feedback during workouts and give motivation based on your activity history. Workout Buddy analyzes your pace, heart rate, distance and other metrics to deliver real-time encouragement and performance insights directly through connected Bluetooth headphones. It works in conjunction with the Workout app on <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/wearables/best-apple-watch-160005462.html\" data-i13n=\"cpos:1;pos:1\">Apple Watch</a> and is partially controlled through the Fitness app on <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/best-iphone-160012979.html\" data-i13n=\"cpos:2;pos:1\">iPhone</a>. This guide walks you through everything needed to set up and use Workout Buddy effectively during workouts.</p><h2 id=\"jump-link-what-workout-buddy-does\">What Workout Buddy does</h2><p>It’s important to note that Workout Buddy is not a full coaching program. Instead, it adds to your workout with spoken cues that reflect how your session is going. Workout Buddy can remind you of your weekly activity totals, alert you to personal bests or performance milestones and provide an overview when you’re finished. It is designed to feel like a supportive training partner rather than a strict coach.</p><p>The feature operates in English by default and uses a text-to-speech model trained on voices from Apple Fitness+ trainers. It is available for a subset of workout types, including running, walking, cycling, high-intensity interval training (HIIT) and strength training. It requires on-device Apple Intelligence, which means you’ll need to keep one of the latest iPhones running updated software nearby during workouts.&nbsp;</p><p>Supported models include iPhone 15 Pro, iPhone 15 Pro Max and any iPhone 16 model. You’ll also need an Apple Watch running watchOS 26.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h2 id=\"jump-link-requirements-before-you-begin\">Requirements before you begin</h2><p>Before Workout Buddy appears in your Fitness app or Workout app you must ensure a few things are in place. First, your Apple Watch must be running watchOS 26 or later and paired to an iPhone with iOS 26 installed. Second, your iPhone must be capable of on-device Apple Intelligence, meaning you must own one of the supported iPhone models we mentioned above and have Apple Intelligence enabled in the phone’s settings.</p><p>You’ll also need Bluetooth headphones paired with either your iPhone or your Apple Watch. Workout Buddy’s audio feedback cannot play through the watch speaker so headphones are essential. Lastly, your device language must be set to English, at least initially. If any of these things are missing, the option to enable Workout Buddy may not appear.</p><h2 id=\"jump-link-how-to-turn-on-workout-buddy-from-iphone\">How to turn on Workout Buddy from iPhone</h2><p>While much of the interaction with Workout Buddy happens on Apple Watch during workouts, you can enable it and choose voice options from the Fitness app on iPhone.</p><p>Open the Fitness app on your iPhone and tap the <strong>Workout</strong> tab at the bottom. Scroll through the list of workout types until you find one you plan to use with Workout Buddy. Tap the waveform bubble icon associated with that workout. This will bring up settings where you can turn on Workout Buddy. Flip the toggle to enable it and choose a voice from the available options. Once you have selected a voice, close that screen and your choice is saved. When you start this workout type on Apple Watch, Workout Buddy will activate.</p><p>Enabling Workout Buddy for a workout type on iPhone means you do not need to toggle it on separately on Apple Watch each time for that specific workout. However, you may still adjust it from the watch interface for more granular control.</p><h2 id=\"jump-link-how-to-turn-on-workout-buddy-on-apple-watch\">How to turn on Workout Buddy on Apple Watch</h2><p>To use Workout Buddy during a session, open the Workout app on your Apple Watch. Turn the Digital Crown to scroll through and select the workout you want to do, such as Outdoor Run, Outdoor Walk, Outdoor Cycle, HIIT or Strength Training. If you want to see all available workouts, tap the <strong>Add</strong> button at the bottom.</p><p>Once the workout type is selected, look for the Alerts button on screen. Tap <strong>Alerts</strong> then scroll until you see Workout Buddy. Tap <strong>Workout Buddy</strong> and flip the switch to on. You will then be asked to choose a voice if one is not already selected on your iPhone. After selecting the voice, return to the previous screen and tap Start. Workout Buddy will begin working as soon as the workout does.</p><h2 id=\"jump-link-using-workout-buddy-during-a-workout\">Using Workout Buddy during a workout</h2><p>Once you start an exercise on your Watch or iPhone, Workout Buddy will speak to you through your connected headphones. The feedback is designed to be encouraging and relevant to your pace, performance or milestones. It may mention your current progress toward activity goals, pace, splits, personal bests or other highlights from your fitness data. At the end of your session Workout Buddy will offer a summary of key metrics like duration distance and calorie burn.</p><p>While a workout is active, you can temporarily mute the audio if you need silence. On Apple Watch during the session, swipe right to reveal controls then tap <strong>Mute</strong>. This pauses Workout Buddy’s spoken commentary without disabling the feature entirely.</p><h2 id=\"jump-link-customizing-and-managing-workout-buddy-settings\">Customizing and managing Workout Buddy settings</h2><p>Workout Buddy is enabled on a per-workout-type basis. If you prefer voice feedback for running but silence for strength training, you can enable it for one and leave it off for the other. The Fitness app on iPhone allows you to set a default voice preference for each workout type. On Apple Watch you can quickly toggle the feature on or off before starting a session.</p><p>If Workout Buddy does not appear as an option for a particular workout type, you may need to check compatibility. Apple’s documentation indicates that only certain types* are supported initially and that the option will not appear for unsupported workouts.</p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><em>*Apple Watch SE (2nd generation), Apple Watch SE 3, Apple Watch Series 6, Apple Watch Series 7, Apple Watch Series 8, Apple Watch Series 9, Apple Watch Series 10, Apple Watch Series 11, Apple Watch Ultra, Apple Watch Ultra 2, Apple Watch Ultra 3</em></p><h2 id=\"jump-link-troubleshooting-common-issues\">Troubleshooting common issues</h2><p>If Workout Buddy fails to activate make sure your devices meet the requirements outlined above. Confirm that your iPhone with Apple Intelligence is nearby and that Bluetooth headphones are connected. If audio feedback is missing, ensure headphones are paired correctly and that the language is set to English. Some users have reported that if the headphones are paired only to the Watch rather than the iPhone, it can interfere with feedback. Switching to the iPhone often resolves that issue.</p><p>For workout types where Workout Buddy previously worked but suddenly does not appear, you may try toggling the feature off and on again in the Fitness app or rebooting both devices. In rare cases removing and re-adding the workout type on Apple Watch can refresh the settings.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/wearables/how-to-use-workout-buddy-with-apple-watch-and-ios-26-130000922.html?src=rss",

    "body": "<p>Welcome to our latest roundup of what&#39;s going on in the indie game space. It’s been a very busy week of fun game releases (next week will be too!), so let’s get into some of them after a quick reflection on gaming while traveling.</p><p>I love my Steam Deck. I really truly do. It’s a fantastic machine. And yet when I brought it with me on a five-week trip over the holidays, I used it for barely an hour the entire time. That doesn’t really justify the space and weight it takes up in my bag. The same holds true for my Nintendo Switch 2 and PlayStation Portal.&nbsp;</p><p>I’ll be leaving them all at home next time. I’ll take a small controller (probably <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/gaming/another-look-at-ohsnaps-mcon-a-magnetic-game-controller-for-your-phone-042424092.html\" data-i13n=\"cpos:1;pos:1\">OhSnap&#39;s MCON</a>) so I can play the odd game on my laptop or phone. I’ll bring my Playdate as well. I adore that little yellow console, and I haven’t spent nearly enough time using it. I have a lot of neat-looking indie games to catch up on there (<a target=\"_blank\" class=\"link\" href=\"https://play.date/games/diora/\" data-i13n=\"cpos:2;pos:1\"><em>Diora</em></a> looks particularly interesting). I’m more likely to play something on a flight if it’s on a device I can pull out from my pocket. I just wish Panic had put a backlight in the Playdate.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=\"jump-link-new-releases\">New releases</h2><p></p><div><div style=\"left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;\"><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/9YH21SghaUU?rel=0\" style=\"top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;\" allowfullscreen scrolling=\"no\" data-embed-domain=\"youtube.com\" data-provider-name=\"youtube\"></iframe></div></div><p>Massive Monster and publisher Devolver Digital gave <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/cult-of-the-lamb-is-finally-getting-a-co-op-mode-but-its-local-only-180715026.html\" data-i13n=\"cpos:3;pos:1\"><em>Cult of the Lamb</em></a><em> </em>fans a whole bunch of reasons to jump back into the game this week with the arrival of the <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/gaming/cult-of-the-lambs-next-dlc-is-woolhaven-out-in-early-2026-225129643.html\" data-i13n=\"cpos:4;pos:1\"><em>Woolhaven </em>expansion</a>. You&#39;ll need to get close to the end of the base game (though you don&#39;t need to beat the final boss) before you can experience what the DLC has to offer. It includes weather effects, a new mountain area with a pair of fresh dungeons, <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/this-is-how-the-new-ranching-system-will-work-in-cult-of-the-lamb-woolhaven-194324041.html\" data-i13n=\"cpos:5;pos:1\">a ranching system</a> (which allows you to raise animals as pets or for food) and much more.</p><p>Folks who dig <em>Cult of the Lamb </em>seem to get really into the game. After a few years of free updates from Massive Monster, <em>Woolhaven </em>is a major expansion that&#39;s similar in scope to the base game, so it should keep fans busy for quite a while if they want to try everything. The DLC is out now on <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"link\" href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/app/3840050/Cult_of_the_Lamb_Woolhaven/\" data-i13n=\"cpos:6;pos:1\">PC</a>, Nintendo Switch, PS4, PS5, Xbox Series X/S and Xbox One.

Over five decades, an array of books, letters and journals were fed into the machine as part of an effort to &quot;crack the code of reality.&quot; But now you&#39;re tasked with finding and destroying one specific book before a timer runs out.</p><p>It all seems rather mysterious. To give you a sense of what&#39;s going on here, Inkle says it drew inspiration from narrative deduction games like <em>The Roottrees are Dead, The Return of the Obra Dinn </em>and <em>Her Story</em>, as well as audio dramas. I can&#39;t see myself having the time or patience to figure out the enigma of this particular machine (I imagine many players will need a notebook for this one), but I&#39;m intrigued enough to at least watch a Let&#39;s Play at some point.

    "body": "<p>Meta is being sued by <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"link\" href=\"https://solosglasses.com/\" data-i13n=\"cpos:1;pos:1\">Solos</a>, a rival smart glasses maker, for infringing on its patents, <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-01-23/meta-essilorluxottica-sued-in-smart-glasses-patent-case\" data-i13n=\"cpos:2;pos:1\"><em>Bloomberg</em> reports</a>. Solos is seeking &quot;multiple billions of dollars&quot; in damages and an injunction that could prevent Meta from selling its Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses as part of the lawsuit.</p><p>Solos claims that Meta&#39;s <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-review-instagram-worthy-shades-070010365.html\" data-i13n=\"cpos:3;pos:1\">Ray-Ban Meta Wayfarer Gen 1 smart glasses</a> violate multiple patents covering &quot;core technologies in the field of smart eyewear.&quot; While less well known than Meta and its partner EssilorLuxottica, Solos sells multiple pairs of glasses with similar features to what Meta offers. For example, the company&#39;s <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"link\" href=\"https://solosglasses.com/\" data-i13n=\"cpos:4;pos:1\">AirGo A5 glasses</a> lets you control music playback and automatically translate speech into different languages, and integrates ChatGPT for answering questions and searching the web.</p><p>Beyond the product similarities, Solos claims that Meta was able to copy its patents because Oakley (an EssilorLuxottica subsidiary) and Meta employees had insights into the company&#39;s products and road map. Solos says that in 2015, Oakley employees were introduced to the company&#39;s smart glasses tech, and were even given a pair of Solos glasses for testing in 2019. Solos also says that a MIT Sloan Fellow who researched the company&#39;s products and later became a product manager at Meta, brought knowledge of the company to her role. According to the logic of Solos&#39; lawsuit, by the time Meta and EssilorLuxottica were selling their own smart glasses, &quot;both sides had accumulated years of direct, senior-level and increasingly detailed knowledge of Solos&#39; smart glasses technology.&quot;</p><p>Engadget has asked both Meta and EssilorLuxottica to comment on Solos&#39; claims. We&#39;ll update this article if we hear back.</p><p>While fewer people own Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses than use Instagram, Meta considers the wearable one of its few hardware success stories. The company is so convinced it can make smart glasses happen that it <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/ar-vr/meta-refocuses-on-ai-hardware-as-metaverse-layoffs-begin-145924706.html\" data-i13n=\"cpos:5;pos:1\">recently restructured its Reality Labs division</a> to focus on AI hardware like smart glasses and hopefully build on its success. </p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/wearables/a-rival-smart-glasses-company-is-suing-meta-over-its-ray-ban-products-205000997.html?src=rss",

It supports onboard calibration for the triggers, joystick and 6-axis gyroscope. There are four programmable buttons (including macro support) on the backside. The company promises a 1,000Hz polling rate in wired and wireless modes.

The new US entity is called <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"link\" href=\"https://usdsjv.tiktok.com/\" data-i13n=\"cpos:2;pos:1\">TikTok USDS Joint Venture</a>. ByteDance has retained a 19.9 percent percent stake in the new business, with the rest controlled by a group of non-Chinese investors, including Oracle, Silver Lake and MGX, an Emirati-state owned investment firm, all of which have a 15 percent stake.

The entity promises interoperability, as well, promising that users will still get international content and, if they’re a creator, viewers. “The safeguards provided by the Joint Venture will also cover CapCut, and Lemon8 and a portfolio of other apps and websites in the US,” TikTok said.</p><p>The new entity will be overseen by a seven-member board of directors, most of whom are Americans. It includes, Shou Chew, the Chief Executive Officer of TikTok, Silver Lake co-CEO Egon Durban, Oracle Executive Vice President Kenneth Glueck and MGX Chief Strategy and Safety Officer David Scott. Adam Presser, who had previously been head of operations and trust and safety at TikTok, is the CEO of TikTok USDS Joint Venture.</p><p>Exactly what the new joint venture means for US users of TikTok is unclear.

If you&#39;re the type of person to view every extra feature as a component that could potentially go wrong, basic iceboxes are probably the kind you go for.

That said, there are a ton of configurations, including the choice of a smaller 9-inch panel or models without a display at all. The latter looks like a big rectangle, but in a way that Dieter Rams would probably appreciate (I&#39;m just guessing, I don&#39;t have his contact info). Other options include setups ranging from four-door models to side-by-side two-door variants or even a single-panel upright model.&nbsp;</p>\n<figure>\n <img src=\"https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/bespoke-front.jpg\" data-crop-orig-src=\"https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/bespoke-front.jpg\" style=\"height:1200px;width:1920px;\" alt=\"Glare is one of the tiny downsides of a fridge with a glass front. \" data-uuid=\"f1d4f78c-6f26-4f88-9c24-ef3b7177f456\">\n <figcaption>\n  Glare is one of the tiny downsides of a fridge with a glass front. \n </figcaption>\n <div class=\"photo-credit\">\n  Sam Rutherford for Engadget\n </div>\n</figure>\n<p>On my review unit, the fresh food section is a touch smaller (16.5 cubic feet) than you might expect from a fridge this size, though I&#39;ve never really felt limited by the amount of available storage. Samsung does a good job of optimizing interior space by providing a number of adjustable shelves, including a sliding one on the right side that makes it easy to store taller items without completely sacrificing flat space for others. The shelves are also spill proof and made out of tempered glass, so they resist scratches and just look a bit nicer than those made from lower-quality materials. I also appreciate how Samsung found a spot between the two crisper drawers for the water filter, instead of just sticking it in the top corner like a lot of competitors.&nbsp;</p>\n<figure>\n <img src=\"https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/bespoke-inside.jpg\" data-crop-orig-src=\"https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/bespoke-inside.jpg\" style=\"height:1200px;width:1920px;\" alt=\"Even with the FlexZone drawer stealing some space, the main section of this Bespoke model still features 16.5 cubic feet of storage. \" data-uuid=\"3b973ffe-277f-47c0-9e41-b858d48b5b80\">\n <figcaption>\n  Even with the FlexZone drawer stealing some space, the main section of this Bespoke model still features 16.5 cubic feet of storage. \n </figcaption>\n <div class=\"photo-credit\">\n  Sam Rutherford for Engadget\n </div>\n</figure>\n<p>Meanwhile, in exchange for a slightly smaller main cabinet, this model has what Samsung calls a FlexZone drawer, which might be my second favorite thing about this fridge. It&#39;s perfectly designed for storing things like 12-ounce cans and juice boxes, and as someone who always likes to keep a couple of chilled Coke Zeros on standby, it&#39;s super convenient. That said, taller bottled drinks may need to be stored on their sides, which doesn&#39;t feel quite as efficient. But really, you can put anything you want in there and if you have young children like me, it&#39;s an excellent place to keep refrigerated kids&#39; snacks. My four-year-old can go in there on his own without needing help from an adult to reach stuff higher up. Samsung even gives you the ability to set a different temperature for the FlexDrawer, which is a nice touch.</p>\n<figure>\n <img src=\"https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/bespoke-flexzone.jpg\" data-crop-orig-src=\"https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/bespoke-flexzone.jpg\" style=\"height:1200px;width:1920px;\" alt=\"The optional FlexZone drawer is amazing for stashing drinks or having a refrigerated section that&#39;s easy for kids to reach. \" data-uuid=\"9bd12016-1ec5-4c49-bc9a-3bee4905b454\">\n <figcaption>\n  The optional FlexZone drawer is amazing for stashing drinks or having a refrigerated section that&#39;s easy for kids to reach. \n </figcaption>\n <div class=\"photo-credit\">\n  Sam Rutherford for Engadget\n </div>\n</figure>\n<p>Additionally, along with some rivals from LG, this fridge also has touch sensors at the bottom of each door that let you open them with a light tap. While I still prefer to just grab the built-in handles (which are located both above and below each door), this is a nice inclusion, particularly on a fridge that doesn&#39;t have giant handgrips bolted to the outside. My one small gripe with Samsung&#39;s exterior design is that its top isn&#39;t completely flat as it dips down in back. Admittedly, this hasn&#39;t stopped me from storing stuff like sheet pans and roasting trays above the fridge, but it would be nicer if things were fully level up there.&nbsp;</p>\n<h2 id=\"jump-link-water-and-ice-dispensing-samsungs-beverage-center-reigns-supreme\">Water and ice dispensing: Samsung&#39;s Beverage Center reigns supreme</h2>\n<p>I&#39;ve already gone <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/home/smart-home/samsungs-beverage-center-is-the-best-fridge-feature-competitors-cant-copy-130000113.html\" data-i13n=\"cpos:4;pos:1\">on record about how Samsung&#39;s Beverage Center</a> is the best new feature to land on any fridge in years, so without belaboring the point, but I&#39;ll happily wax poetic about it again. Instead of having a water dispenser installed smack dab on the outside of the door, Samsung opted to hide things behind an exterior flap on the left side of the fridge. This accomplishes several things. Not only does it feel a bit more hygienic because the spigot isn&#39;t subjected directly to all the germs swirling around the kitchen or a cough or sneeze from anyone passing by, it also simplifies the fridge&#39;s exterior design. This might sound a bit weird, but I&#39;ve always thought that putting water dispensers on the outside of a fridge was kind of like installing a shower in the middle of a room. It&#39;s just kind of awkward. Furthermore, by opening the Beverage Center&#39;s door, you also have access to one of the fridge&#39;s interior shelves, which makes it quick and easy to grab things like ketchup, mustard or any other sauces you might need for a meal. My wife stashes her matcha there, so it&#39;s readily available first thing in the morning.&nbsp;</p>\n<figure>\n <img src=\"https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/bespoke-beverage-center.jpg\" data-crop-orig-src=\"https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/bespoke-beverage-center.jpg\" style=\"height:1200px;width:1920px;\" alt=\"Samsung&#39;s Beverage Center is one of the best fridge innovations and years. It includes both a water dispenser and a built-in pitcher that refills itself automatically. \" data-uuid=\"8bd6a819-f9d3-45ce-afac-742f4d4ebcf0\">\n <figcaption>\n  Samsung&#39;s Beverage Center is one of the best fridge innovations and years. It includes both a water dispenser and a built-in pitcher that refills itself automatically. \n </figcaption>\n <div class=\"photo-credit\">\n  Sam Rutherford for Engadget\n </div>\n</figure>\n<p>But the most important thing is that right next to the spigot, there&#39;s also a built-in water pitcher that automatically refills itself after every use. This means there&#39;s pretty much always 40+ ounces of ice-cold water (depending on the specific model) that you can pull out and pour. This allows you to fill up everyone&#39;s cup in seconds like a server at a restaurant, instead of blocking the entire fridge while you slowly top off each glass individually. To me, it&#39;s the difference between an active process where you can dictate your own pace versus having to stand there while the machine takes its sweet time. Plus, if you like infusing your water with fruit or tea, there&#39;s a built-in basket filter for that too. The Beverage Center is a truly useful innovation and one of Samsung’s biggest advantages over its rivals, and because <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"link\" href=\"https://patents.google.com/patent/US9085453B2/en\" data-i13n=\"cpos:5;pos:1\">the company patented it</a>, it&#39;ll be years before competitors can come up with copies.</p>\n<figure>\n <img src=\"https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/bespoke-ice.jpg\" data-crop-orig-src=\"https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/bespoke-ice.jpg\" style=\"height:1200px;width:1920px;\" alt=\"The top shelf in the freezer also contains the ice maker, which comes with an included scoop and the ability to make two difference kinds of cubes. \" data-uuid=\"5022dd43-2c59-4715-b748-34a18dc29220\">\n <figcaption>\n  The top shelf in the freezer also contains the ice maker, which comes with an included scoop and the ability to make two difference kinds of cubes. \n </figcaption>\n <div class=\"photo-credit\">\n  Sam Rutherford for Engadget\n </div>\n</figure>\n<p>As for ice, the model I&#39;m testing can produce two different types: regular cubes and smaller pebbles. There&#39;s also an included scooper and a dedicated shelf for storing it. Now I will admit that the smaller pebbles aren&#39;t quite as good as what you get from a standalone nugget-style icemaker, but in my experience they&#39;re more than good enough for anyone who likes variety in their frozen water. My small critique for Samsung is that I&#39;ve heard the ice trays on other models come with sliders that have actual ball bearings instead of plastic rails and I wish the latter were a standard inclusion on every model. There&#39;s never so much friction that anything would get properly stuck, it would just be nice if things slid a bit more smoothly.</p>\n<h2 id=\"jump-link-the-screen-a-welcome-addition-to-a-digital-lifestyle\">The screen: A welcome addition to a digital lifestyle</h2>\n<figure>\n <img src=\"https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/bespoke-memos.jpg\" data-crop-orig-src=\"https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/bespoke-memos.jpg\" style=\"height:1200px;width:1920px;\" alt=\"The fridge&#39;s 32-inch display can be used to write memos or draw, along with a ton of other functions. \" data-uuid=\"11dfc002-04dd-4d10-9580-297a87b4fd4b\">\n <figcaption>\n  The fridge&#39;s 32-inch display can be used to write memos or draw, along with a ton of other functions. \n </figcaption>\n <div class=\"photo-credit\">\n  Sam Rutherford for Engadget\n </div>\n</figure>\n<p>Of course, one of the biggest potential objections about Samsung&#39;s latest fridges may also be one of its biggest strengths: their optional displays. With the continued intrusion of screens into our daily lives, I&#39;m not here to tell you that you need one more. However, even though I was skeptical at first, I&#39;ve grown to really appreciate having one on the fridge and I&#39;d argue that unless you&#39;re skipping the feature entirely, the larger 32-inch panel is what you want.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The main reason is that, at least for my family, so much of what we do is already digital. Things like calendars, shopping lists, recipes and family photos already live on my phone and being able to share all of that with the fridge directly via Wi-Fi is a major plus. Frankly, it&#39;s easier to upload a picture to the fridge&#39;s display than it is to print one out and post it, which goes double for Samsung&#39;s Bespoke line since its glass front means magnets don&#39;t stick. Even though I already have a smart display in our kitchen, the size of Samsung&#39;s screen, along with support for a handful of important apps, have turned the fridge into a better family hub than anything else we own. Because there&#39;s so much space, there&#39;s room for photos, memos, the weather, filter status and a full 30-day calendar — the latter of which has significantly improved my family&#39;s planning and coordination.</p>\n<figure>\n <img src=\"https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/bespoke-tv.jpg\" data-crop-orig-src=\"https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/bespoke-tv.jpg\" style=\"height:1200px;width:1920px;\" alt=\"You can even watch TV or YouTube videos right on the fridge&#39;s display. \" data-uuid=\"5d1f2938-d507-43d9-9e9c-cd9e0f0bd59c\">\n <figcaption>\n  You can even watch TV or YouTube videos right on the fridge&#39;s display. \n </figcaption>\n <div class=\"photo-credit\">\n  Sam Rutherford for Engadget\n </div>\n</figure>\n<p>The fridge runs Samsung&#39;s Tizen OS, which is basically the company&#39;s lightweight take on Android, so it&#39;s super easy to use. You can swipe left and right to add additional widgets to your screen, play music or even watch videos (YouTube, Samsung TV Plus, etc.) if you&#39;re so inclined. That said, sometimes I wish the screen was a bit more responsive, because even though I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a dealbreaker, after having reviewed several generations of the company&#39;s phones, I know Samsung can do better. There are also some settings from its handsets that I wish would get ported over to its fridges — like a dedicated dark mode. When I grab a glass of water later at night, the last thing I need is the entire display blasting my kitchen like a pair of hi-beams. </p>\n<h2 id=\"jump-link-ai-inside-a-work-in-progress-with-benefits-today\">AI Inside: A work in progress with benefits today</h2>\n<p>With seemingly every tech company trying to shoehorn AI into its latest products, it&#39;s easy to roll your eyes at the idea of adding that into a fridge as well. And I think even Samsung would admit that its efforts to integrate machine learning into the Bespoke line are a work in progress. I&#39;ve found that while it certainly isn&#39;t essential, the AI features found here can be a handy bonus in the right situations.&nbsp;</p>\n<figure>\n <img src=\"https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/bespoke-camera.jpg\" data-crop-orig-src=\"https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/bespoke-camera.jpg\" style=\"height:1200px;width:1920px;\" alt=\"Bespoke models with AI feature a camera mounted to the top of the fridge that can recognize and take pictures of the food you put inside. \" data-uuid=\"ac96cc37-53e3-4d9c-abd7-888be6ca0539\">\n <figcaption>\n  Bespoke models with AI feature a camera mounted to the top of the fridge that can recognize and take pictures of the food you put inside. \n </figcaption>\n <div class=\"photo-credit\">\n  Sam Rutherford for Engadget\n </div>\n</figure>\n<p>AI Vision is the headline feature in Samsung&#39;s package, which uses machine learning and a camera mounted to the roof of the fridge to automatically recognize and record items you put inside. However, there are some limitations. Currently, Samsung&#39;s AI can detect 37 different food items like fresh fruit and veggies, along with an additional 50 kinds of packaged goods like yogurt. Furthermore, the camera only records what goes into the fridge&#39;s main cabinet, so anything you put in the FlexZone drawer, freezer or either door won&#39;t get recorded. Regardless of whether an item is recognized or not, the fridge will then take a photo of the item (and tag it with the name of the food if it can be properly identified). You can then view a list of everything in the fridge via a dedicated tab on its screen (assuming your model has one) or from your phone via Samsung&#39;s SmartThings app. From there, you can do things like set names for anything uncategorized or add an expiration date, though I wish the fridge would do that last part on its own.</p>\n<figure>\n <img src=\"https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/bespoke-ai-vision.jpg\" data-crop-orig-src=\"https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/bespoke-ai-vision.jpg\" style=\"height:1200px;width:1920px;\" alt=\"The fridge uses AI to automatically track food that it can recognize and applies labels to the corresponding photo. \" data-uuid=\"7a1c43f1-40b2-4627-a716-1d2b67ccaace\">\n <figcaption>\n  The fridge uses AI to automatically track food that it can recognize and applies labels to the corresponding photo. \n </figcaption>\n <div class=\"photo-credit\">\n  Sam Rutherford for Engadget\n </div>\n</figure>\n<p>In practice, this means you just put items in the fridge like you would normally and let the AI sort things out on its own. You can always go through the main list to see if you have a specific item or let the fridge automatically delete things when you take them out. That said, the AI doesn&#39;t get things right every time, because while Samsung&#39;s programming does clear things out after a certain amount of time, you will still need to delete food manually from time to time. Thankfully, for items in the door, the fridge can show you a live feed of what&#39;s there, so if you&#39;re at the store and can&#39;t remember if you have milk or not, you can simply pull out your phone and see for yourself.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Because the camera is mounted to the top of the fridge, you might not get the clearest picture or you may end up with your hand covering part of the food as the fridge takes a picture as you put items inside. Even so, that&#39;s still more than enough for me to be able to tell what something is just by looking at a small icon. I&#39;ve found that Samsung AI Vision legitimately makes it easier to grocery shop by allowing me to see what food I have at a glance, regardless of whether I&#39;m at home or at the store.&nbsp;</p>\n<figure>\n <img src=\"https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/bespoke-meal-planning.jpg\" data-crop-orig-src=\"https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/bespoke-meal-planning.jpg\" style=\"height:1200px;width:1920px;\" alt=\"Samsung also uses AI to suggest recipes based on ingredients you already have in the fridge.

You can even specific things like food preferences and dietary restrictions. \n </figcaption>\n <div class=\"photo-credit\">\n  Sam Rutherford for Engadget\n </div>\n</figure>\n<p>On top of that, the fridge also has built-in meal planning capabilities. This means you can ask the fridge to come up with a dish based on ingredients you already have, and it&#39;s surprisingly good. Not only do you have the ability to specify preferences and dietary restrictions, there&#39;s a wide variety of recipes it can choose from. On several occasions, I even found that when asked to suggest a recipe, the fridge came up with dishes I already had in mind. Alternatively, it will highlight when you&#39;re missing items for a potential dish, so you can grab them the next time you&#39;re at the store. This is one of the most helpful features, because often at the end of the week, I find myself with a handful of leftover ingredients. So when the fridge uses that info to suggest recipes that use those items, it helps reduce food waste.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Sadly, the weakest part of Samsung&#39;s AI is Bixby. In addition to being overeager when listening for voice prompts, which ended up causing a lot of inadvertent triggers, Samsung also put the Bixby icon near the bottom left corner of the screen. That&#39;s right next to the sensor and handle for the door, resulting in even more unwanted summons. After using this fridge for four months, I wish Bixby would just go away, and it seems Samsung agrees. Sometime later this year, the company is adding support for Google Gemini, which should deliver a massive upgrade to the fridge&#39;s voice-controlled capabilities.</p>\n<h2 id=\"jump-link-a-word-on-ads\">A word on ads</h2>\n<figure>\n <img src=\"https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/bespoke-ads.jpg\" data-crop-orig-src=\"https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/bespoke-ads.jpg\" style=\"height:1200px;width:1920px;\" alt=\"You can disable ads that show up on the fridge&#39;s cover screen, though that will also get rid of the news and weather widgets.

Furthermore, you can disable these ads entirely. The downside is that doing so also gets rid of the rotating news and weather widgets that appear on the home screen. But in my experience, that&#39;s just fine, because I don&#39;t need what is effectively the fridge&#39;s lock screen to have that much going on. Plus, when you open the fridge or touch its screen, it instantly reverts to the main home menu, which includes its own set of widgets that you can customize how you like.</p>\n<h2 id=\"jump-link-some-quick-notes-and-observations\">Some quick notes and observations</h2>\n<figure>\n <img src=\"https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/bespoke-beverage-center-door.jpg\" data-crop-orig-src=\"https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/bespoke-beverage-center-door.jpg\" style=\"height:1200px;width:1920px;\" alt=\"For some reason, the door to the Beverage Center doesn&#39;t soft close like the rest of the doors do. \" data-uuid=\"67cf6a7a-4612-483d-a892-5915f928ab98\">\n <figcaption>\n  For some reason, the door to the Beverage Center doesn&#39;t soft close like the rest of the doors do. \n </figcaption>\n <div class=\"photo-credit\">\n  Sam Rutherford for Engadget\n </div>\n</figure>\n<p>The Bespoke fridge’s screen does collect smudges, but so does stainless steel, and it doesn&#39;t really impact viewability. And on white glass models like my review unit, the simple design makes it easier to clean and maintain than typical metal-clad rivals.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The door to the Beverage Center doesn&#39;t soft-close like you&#39;d normally expect on a fridge. It&#39;s more of a clack, which isn&#39;t a bad thing on its own, though I hope Samsung changes its design to match the other doors on future models for consistency&#39;s sake.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Because the fridge runs Tizen and not full Android, there aren&#39;t nearly as many choices for widgets. For example, there&#39;s a widget for Spotify and Amazon Music, but not YouTube or Apple Music. There&#39;s also only a single option for weather and a widget for pinning your favorite websites, but very little choice when it comes to dedicated news options. In my testing, the SmartThings integration worked better on Samsung phones compared to standard Android handsets, but your experience may vary.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If you are so inclined, you can create shopping lists directly on the fridge and then order them from partners including Instacart, Amazon Fresh, Walmart and others.&nbsp;</p>\n<h2 id=\"jump-link-wrap-up\">Wrap-up</h2>\n<p>AI in a fridge might sound ridiculous, but it allows for some genuinely useful features, even if the tech suffers from growing pains. And while this might sound preposterous, I think Samsung should actually double down on the tech by adding even more cameras, so the fridge has more angles and viewpoints to choose from as its algorithms evolve. The ability to automatically track what goes in and out of the fridge makes it easier to both shop and plan meals, and this is just in the early stages of the tech.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>That said, obsessing over AI is sort of besides the point because even without it, Samsung&#39;s Bespoke French Door fridge is a first-class icebox. For tech-savvy people, its big screen helps simplify and organize our digital lives while simultaneously allowing the fridge to be helpful in ways you might not have even considered. It&#39;s also well-built and exquisitely designed to fit in seamlessly with other modern devices, which feels refreshing considering how often appliances feel like they are lagging years or decades behind gadgets like phones and laptops. And I can&#39;t overstate how much I like Samsung&#39;s Beverage Center, which in my opinion, is so good it&#39;s worth going with a Bespoke fridge just for that one feature.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In the end, the two biggest factors you&#39;ll need to consider are price and your appetite to digitize your kitchen, and by extension, your life. Starting at $3,500 for AI-equipped Bespoke models, Samsung&#39;s top-of-the-line fridges are far from cheap. Thankfully, versions without machine learning can be had for much less. But more importantly, you have to be willing to embrace technology&#39;s role in your home. You may not agree or want to pay this much for features like this just yet, but Samsung&#39;s Bespoke AI 4-Door French Door refrigerator has convinced me there&#39;s a happy home for smarter iceboxes.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/home/kitchen-tech/samsung-bespoke-fridge-with-ai-review-all-the-bells-and-whistles-140000099.html?src=rss",

The company says that every video downloaded from Ring starting in December 2025 going forward will come with a digital security seal. “Think of it like the tamper-evident seal on a medicine bottle,” it explained. Its new tool, called <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"link\" href=\"https://blog.ring.com/about-ring/your-ring-videos-verified/\" data-i13n=\"cpos:2;pos:1\">Ring Verify</a>, can tell you if a video has been altered in any way. Even adjusting a video clip’s brightness or trimming a few seconds off will break that seal, and the tool will tell you that it cannot be verified. All you have to do is visit the <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"link rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=b50ccd99-4c85-48e0-a2ed-9c2b9b65422b&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=9d4563e0-3185-47a5-a9a4-8c4221e5d167&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Ring&amp;linkText=tool%E2%80%99s+web+page&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3JpbmcuY29tL3BhZ2VzL3ZlcmlmeSIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiOWQ0NTYzZTAtMzE4NS00N2E1LWE5YTQtOGM0MjIxZTVkMTY3Iiwib3JpZ2luYWxVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3JpbmcuY29tL3BhZ2VzL3ZlcmlmeSJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAUS4iAeOWt2tzx66SYE10UaF50uRahLMGdh46N64T8MV&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fring.com%2Fpages%2Fverify\" data-i13n=\"elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Ring;elmt:;cpos:3;pos:1\" data-original-link=\"https://ring.com/pages/verify\">tool’s web page</a> and upload the video you want to check. </p><p>In the era of AI, you can also use the tool to make sure you’re looking at a real Ring video instead of something generated by artificial intelligence models. OpenAI’s <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/ai/openai-now-sells-extra-sora-credits-for-4-plans-to-reduce-free-gens-in-the-future-223905628.html\" data-i13n=\"cpos:4;pos:1\">Sora</a>, for instance, can easily create Ring video doorbell footage with just a prompt or two, leading to a lot of fake security cam footage on social media apps. The company suggests asking the owner of the camera to share videos straight from the Ring app to make sure they’re unaltered. It also doesn’t matter what camera it is: All of the company’s models now embed digital security seals to downloaded videos and videos shared from Ring’s cloud storage. However, the tool can only tell you if a video has been tampered with or can’t be verified at all. It can’t tell you what has been edited or if it’s AI-generated. </p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/home/smart-home/ring-can-now-verify-if-a-video-has-been-altered-140000140.html?src=rss",

This lets you track your fitness and close activity rings similarly to when using an Apple Watch.</p> \n<p>Apple also improved the sound quality of this generation thanks in large part to a redesigned acoustic architecture that improves how air is delivered into the ear canal. Additionally, the company changed the angle of the drivers to help more sound get where it needs to go instead of bouncing off the sides of your ear. We felt the jump in audio quality from the last generation to this one was substantial.</p> \n<p>The ANC on the AirPods Pro 3 has also been improved. Apple claims this model filters out twice as much noise as the AirPods Pro 2 and four times as much as the original AirPods Pro. We found the noise cancellation to be top-notch.</p> \n<p>Live Translation is as neat as it sounds, leveraging the AirPods&#39; noise cancellation tech, Apple&#39;s AI and beam-forming mics to help you understand a speaker in a different language. Right now, this is limited to a handful of languages with more being added over time.</p> \n<p>It&#39;s not often you see one of Apple&#39;s best and most recent products on sale for 20 percent off, so if you&#39;re in the market for an upgrade or your first set of AirPods, consider taking advantage of this deal.</p> \n<p><em>Follow </em><a data-i13n=\"cpos:3;pos:1\" href=\"https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals\"><em>@EngadgetDeals</em></a><em> on X for the latest </em><a data-i13n=\"cpos:4;pos:1\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/deals/\"><em>tech deals</em></a><em> and </em><a data-i13n=\"cpos:5;pos:1\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/best-tech/\"><em>buying advice</em></a><em>.</em></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/apples-airpods-pro-3-drop-back-down-to-a-record-low-price-140752588.html?src=rss",
